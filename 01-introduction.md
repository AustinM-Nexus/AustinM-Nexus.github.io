Twice every day, all cities suddenly explode with life. Once in the morning when we scurry off to where we are needed, and once in the evening when we finally return to a warm, cozy, home - a personal refuge.

And on the weekends, the streets become packed with those recharging themselves for another week’s worth of hard work. Most of us throw ourselves onto every corner of the city, whether it be on a brisk jog, seeking a runner’s high, or a quick drink with our friends. We fill these streets with energy and ourselves with stories to tell after a good night’s fun.

In these moments of privileged fun, there are stories that we do not see, the stories that we perhaps choose to ignore. The community of ten or so people living underneath the bridge, inhaling the fumes of cars passing by is more often than not completely invisible to the common jogger. In the shadow of the bright, bumbling nightlife near the beach or the river sleep the homeless on their cardboard boxes.

In every housing utopia or the top-15 CNN Vacation Destinations, there are hundreds of thousands of such stories that fall through the cracks. Throughout this journey, I aim to examine and bring to light the experiences and problems the homeless face in the darkness to the general public.

Welcome to the Nexus of Homelessness.

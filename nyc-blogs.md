        <h3>City Moving 6,000 Homeless New Yorkers From Shelters to Hotels by April 20</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2020.04.11</p>
      </header>
      <p>
        For weeks, advocates for those experiencing homeless have called on the de Blasio administration to send thousands of homeless New Yorkers to hotels to protect them from COVID-19. On Saturday, the mayor agreed to do that, at least in part.
      </p>

        The mayor said a total of 6,000 single adult homeless individuals, a third of the population, will be in hotels as of April 20. Already, 3,500 single homeless people are in commercial hotels. The city will be adding thousands more — including seniors and individuals in shelters that are especially crowded.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Those who will be prioritized across our shelter system for transfer to hotels will include seniors, will include, of course, anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 or who tested positive will be isolated in hotel setting, and anybody in shelters where it’s been difficult to achieve social distancing,” de Blasio said during his new conference.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many shelters across the city, homeless New Yorkers live in dorm room settings, which make it impossible to socially distance. The new move is supposed to protect the homeless from the spread of coronavirus.

        Advocates of the homeless called Mayor de Blasio to rent hotel rooms for street homeless to protect them from COVID-19. Currently, 3,500 single homeless are put into commercial hotel rooms and 6,000 will be in hotel rooms by April of 2020. Seniors, anyone with COVID-19 symptoms or anyone tested positive to COVID-19 will be prioritized to a transfer from shelters to the commercial hotel room. Social distancing in shelters have been difficult as the shelters are structured similar to a dorm room setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, de Blasio’s administration’s attempts of renting out hotel rooms as a temporary shelter for street homelessness have been heavily criticized by the advocates of homelessness. Rending out hotel rooms was critiqued to be a short-run and costly measure to get rid of homelessness appearance and push them away rather than providing much needed affordable housing and contacts with the budget spent. However, as COVID-19 set an unforeseeable challenge in social distancing in shelters, the advocates strongly requested for the once heavily criticized measure - renting out commercial and luxurious hotel rooms. Although it is a temporary measure, New York must earn some time to design a long-term or more sustainable measure to enforce social distancing in shelters. A less costly measure would be to subsidize mask manufacturers and enforce mask-wearing at all times in the shelter.

        <h3>Closing New York subway will have ‘devastating’ impact on homeless, experts warn</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2020.05.06</p>

      <blockquote>
        System will shut down every night for cleaning, forcing homeless on to streets or into shelters where over 700 have tested positive
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        New measures to close the New York subway for nightly coronavirus cleaning will have “devastating” consequences for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/12/new-york-homeless-subways-police-crackdown" target="blank">thousands of homeless people who regularly sleep there</a>, experts have warned.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>New York police officers clear train cars of passengers at the last stop at the Coney Island station in Brooklyn, New York, on Tuesday.</i></span>
        <p>
          Starting on Wednesday, for the first time in its history the usually 24-hour service will shut down every night between 1am and 5am to be disinfected in a bid to improve travel conditions for essential workers during the Covid-19 outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But homelessness groups and charities said the move will have “counterproductive and harmful” impacts for those who seek safety and shelter in subway trains and stations – forcing them on to the streets or into the city’s shelters, where more than 700 people have tested positive for coronavirus in recent weeks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        “It’s actually extraordinarily counterproductive and harmful,” said Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, which works with 3,500 people in New York every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What’s happening is that large groups of police officers are gathering at the end of the [subway] line, telling people to move, forcing people often to the streets, offering them access to congregate shelters which many are rightfully refusing to enter because of the safety issues and not actually offering real solutions to help people access a safer space.”
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2-1.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>New York police officers clear the platform of passengers at the last stop at the Coney Island station in Brooklyn, New York, on 6 May.</i></span>
        <p>
          New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, who recently referred to a picture of homeless people on the subway as “disgusting” and “disrespectful to the essential workers”, made the announcement about closures last week amid concerns about conditions on the subway. More homeless people are thought to be seeking shelter on trains, while passenger numbers have dropped by 92%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Routhier said the new policy will encourage a “more punitive approach”, leaving homeless people vulnerable to the elements and potentially the criminal justice system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Conditions for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/14/hudson-yards-homeless-tunnels-living-below-development" target="blank">New York’s homeless</a> are already “dire”, she added, especially with many of the city’s cafes, restaurants, public bathrooms, gyms and food banks that many rely on for hygiene and nourishment closed. Demand for Coalition for the Homeless’s mobile food programme has doubled on some nights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the virus is spreading in the city’s shelters – which many homeless people already feared for safety reasons before the outbreak. As of Tuesday, there had been 829 positive cases – 705 of which were in shelters – and 65 deaths.

      <div>
        <span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2-2.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>An MTA worker cleans a subway car on 5 May.</i></span>
        <p>
          Routhier believes the true number of cases could be higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t know that there’s really a precedent in our lifetime,” she said. “What we’re seeing now is a devastating event that is continuing to go on and on.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, 62,679 people are living in New York’s <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/facts-about-homelessness/" target="blank">shelters</a>, but this does not include the thousands living on the city’s streets and subway – a number which experts say is growing as the economic impact of the pandemic takes hold.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Joshua Goldfein, an attorney at the Legal Aid Society and a member of its Homeless Rights Project, said all homeless people should be offered hotel rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We have tens of thousands of empty hotel rooms in New York City right now, and rates that those hotels are asking for those rooms are much lower than they were before this, and Fema [Federal Emergency Management Agency] is going to pay for that, so it would be very simple to move people into hotel rooms, to offer case management services onsite.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The city said it is using hotels, but that it is prioritising relocating older people and single adults “based on risk” from larger shelters. So far, they said about 7,000 people have been moved to hotels from shelters, with plans for 1,000 more “each week as needed”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the new subway plan, more than 100 outreach workers will be deployed to 30 high-priority stations to “engage” homeless people when it closes about services, assess them for symptoms and connect them to care, isolation or shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For essential workers, there will be extra buses between 1am and 5am and an “essential connector” programme of free cabs.

        <span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2-3.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>Workers clean the Grand Central subway station on 5 May.</i></span>
        <p>
          New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has said the closures will enable the city to help people <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-and-mayor-de" target="blank">more effectively</a>. But Josh Dean, executive director of the street homelessness organisation Human.nyc, said it will put many on the streets – potentially in an unfamiliar area. He also fears it will breach trust and damage existing relationships between homeless people and social workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is going to be a tragedy,” he said. “Tonight [Tuesday] at the same time 2,000 homeless folks or more are going to be thrown out of the train and into the streets … The impact of that is really going to be devastating.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In recent days he said he has already witnessed police ordering homeless people to get off trains at end of the line stations at night.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        He added: “They even forced a man with one shoe out into the rain one night. So it’s a pretty brutal and cruel operation.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In collaboration with other organisations, Human.nyc has raised more than $63,000 for its #homelesscantstayhome campaign which has so far housed 27 people in hotels. Anthony Williams, 57, who has been homeless on and off for decades, had been sleeping on the subway for the last two and a half years until he got a room in a hotel through the campaign three days ago.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        He said: “Now that Covid-19 exists and they’re shutting it [the subway] down it leaves a void. Where do people go to find their safety, to sleep?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        He predicts some people will sleep in the day on the subway and walk the streets at night or try to hide in abandoned train stations or tunnels. But, he said, they will not go in shelters – both because of coronavirus and, like him, have negative past experiences.

        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2-4.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>MTA workers prepare to clean a subway car on 6 May.</i></span>
        <p>
          He said he found the new police approach “intimidating” and “aggressive”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelly Doran, an emergency physician and faculty member in the departments of emergency medicine and population health at NYU School of Medicine, said homeless people are especially vulnerable to Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premature ageing and higher rates of illnesses such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes and obesity combined with racial disparities, she added, are “compounding together to make this population at particular risk”.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If homeless people are not offered their own rooms, she said infection will continue. “Essentially they’re just displacing somebody from one bad setting to another bad setting is not decreasing risk of contracting coronavirus.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) said all passengers will have to leave trains and stations and there will be shuttle buses to transport homeless people. It said police will continue to work with them to connect homeless people to “the medical care and social services they need and deserve”.
      </p>

        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2020-2-5.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>A passenger sleeps inside a subway car at the last stop at the Coney Island station on 6 May.</i></span>
        <p>
          A New York police department (NYPD) spokesperson said officers are patrolling the subways with nurses and that “homelessness is not a crime”. But they added: “Without a doubt, disruptive passengers are more visible now and burglaries are up. We are working hard to address both these issues.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the city’s social and homeless services departments, said they are “adapting and responding to meet need at a scale and speed never before seen, as we have in our pandemic response since this crisis began” and that they are in “regular conversations” with Fema.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fema said it has conditionally approved New York state’s request for “non-congregate sheltering assistance”. New York state did not respond to requests for comment.

        New measures to close the New York subway for nightly cleaning due to COVIC-19 will have “devastating” consequences for thousands of homeless riders who frequently spend the nights there. The subway trains will be disinfected from 1 AM to 5 AM every morning which is expected to have “counterproductive and harmful” impacts for about 3,500 homeless riders, according to Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless. Routhier claimed the policy will encourage a “more punitive approach”, further marginalizing the homeless to the criminal justice system. There have been 829 positive cases amongst the homeless population, 705 of which were in shelters and 65 deaths.  Joshua Goldfein, attorney at the Legal Aid Society and a member of the Homeless Rights Project,  claimed all homeless people should be offered hotel rooms. Under a new subway plan, 100 outreach workers will be deployed to 30 high-priority stations to encourage the homeless to social distance and isolate them if they show any signs of COVID-19. During 1 AM and 5 PM, an “essential connector” program of free cabs will be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mandatory cleaning time creates a void for homeless riders dependent on the subway for shelter. Although alternatives were provided by New York, it is not enough to encompass the large population. Further, some homeless found new policy forces to get them off trains to be “intimidating” - further risking them being vulnerable. To create enough shelters, hotel rooms would provide short-term solutions. Due to COVID-19, demand for hotel rooms is at the all-time-low, hence there are enough rooms for the riders to be given hotel rooms. For more sustainable measures, New York needs to research and prepare how they could react when vital shelters such as subway trains can no longer be used.

        <h3>NYC pledges to end street homelessness within next five years</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2019.12.17</p>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        The city estimates some 3,600 New Yorkers live on the streets
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mayor Bill de Blasio has unveiled a plan to “end street homelessness as we know it” in the next five years, by bringing thousands of New Yorkers off the streets and into permanent housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city’s latest plan to combat homelessness, dubbed <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2019/12/The-Journey-Home-2019_print_final.pdf" target="blank">“The Journey Home,”</a> aims to create 1,000 new permanent apartments and 1,000 additional “Safe Haven” shelter beds, which specifically target street homeless by having fewer restrictions (e.g. no curfew), according to Steven Banks, the city’s Social Service Commissioner.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left" style="padding: 2.5em 0 0 0;"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2019-1.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>NYC pledged 1,000 new apartments to end street homelessness within the next five years.</i></span>
        <p>
          “We don’t want barriers to be in the way of bringing people off the streets,” Banks said at a press conference unveiling the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some 3,600 homeless people currently live on city streets, officials estimate, among the city’s total homeless population of roughly 80,000 New Yorkers, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-data-show-nearly-80-000-homeless-in-new-york-city-11571922000" target="blank">according to federal data</a>. In the next four years, the city will “on a rolling basis” add to its more than 1,800 transitional beds across the boroughs through partnerships with community groups and faith-based organizations; Catholic Charities has committed to open five such Safe Haven shelters.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Banks, the city has helped nearly 2,500 homeless New Yorkers transition off the streets and into temporary or permanent housing since 2016. Under the new plan, the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development will work to identify privately owned properties with “a large share of vacancies” to be converted into permanent housing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To that end, the city is issuing a “Property Pathways” request for expressions of interest (RFEI) from landlords willing to make their buildings available to street homeless. Unlike with other city homelessness programs, people won’t need to already be in shelters or be employed to qualify for the new “low-barrier” housing. The city did not have details on where it expects the housing to be located, or a timeline for when that process will unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who live on the city’s street are notoriously difficult to serve because they can be skeptical of homeless outreach workers, Banks stressed. But by expanding outreach services, such as the medical and mental care workers can directly offer to the unsheltered, the city hopes to alleviate some of that distrust. Mayor Bill de Blasio said street homelessness is a “high budget priority” for the city and anticipates funds toward addressing the issue will “approach $100 million” in next year’s budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We believe this is literally the resources we need to end longterm street homelessness in this city,” de Blasio said at a press conference. “It’s as simple as that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Homeless advocates, who have long-called on de Blasio to commit additional resources to permanent housing for the homeless, say the housing pledge is “a critical step” toward helping people find safe, permanent homes.

        “We are pleased to see Mayor de Blasio moving toward providing the resources that homeless individuals on the street actually need: permanent housing and low-threshold shelters,” said Giselle Routhier, the policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city’s pledge for more housing comes as it grapples with record levels of homelessness. The de Blasio administration’s controversial move to send homeless New Yorkers to neighboring cities and out of state has landed the city in legal trouble, with officials in Newark, New Jersey <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/02/newark-sues-to-stop-nyc-from-relocating-homeless-to-new-jersey/" target="blank">filing a lawsuit</a> to block the practice. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop announced <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenFulop/status/1207009352940490752" target="blank"> plans to join Newark’s legal challenge</a> during de Blasio’s announcement on street homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        De Blasio has also faced deepening criticism of his affordable housing plan and the little it does to help those transition from shelters into permanent homes. To address these shortcomings, city officials have agreed to force developers of certain affordable housing projects to set aside 15 percent of a property’s units for the formerly homeless. The new requirement is at the heart of legislation that is expected to pass the City Council this week.

        Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to “end street homelessness as we know it” in the next five years. A project called The Journey Home aims to create 1,000 new permanent apartments and 1,000 Safe Havens shelters - a shelter with fewer restrictions. Steven Banks, the city’s Social Service Commissioner, commented the city does not want “barriers to one in the way of bringing people off the streets.” According to the city’s estimate, 80,000 NEw Yorkers are homeless with 3,600 of them living on the streets. In the next five years, the city will be “on a rolling basis” to add 1,800 additional transitional beds across the five boroughs. According to Banks, the city has helped transition 2,500 homeless into temporary or permanent housing since 2016. Further, privately owned properties with “a large share of vacancies” will be converted into permanent housing. However, the city did not have where the housing will be located or the timeline the incidents will unfold. Outreach services will be expanded to cater to the stubborn homeless living on the streets towards outreach workers. Next year, the budget for street homelessness, a “high priority'' according to de Blasio, will increase by $100 million (USD). De Blasio's controversial move to send homeless New Yorkers to different states led to a lawsuit from New Jersey. De Blasio was further criticized for providing little to no help for a transition from shelter to permanent housing services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mayor de Blasio’s effort to increase permanent housing, better-conditioned shelters called Safe Haves will help the homeless people. Further, reduced, and gradually stopped, spending on short-term commercial hotels helped relocation of the homeless budget to helpful long and short-term measures. However, only the foundation needed to solve and stop the cycle of homelessness is done. New York City needs to provide tangible support systems and efficient and streamlined flow of information between departments and to homeless to help homeless residents in shelters successfully transition into permanent housing. Moreover, job training, better education, and medical support are needed to prevent the homeless in permanent housing from becoming homeless again. Further, the root cause - outrageous rent - of homelessness needs to be tackled to prevent future homelessness.

        <h3>Mayor De Blasio Unveils ‘Outreach NYC’ Program To Address Homelessness</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2019.11.14</p>

      <blockquote>
        NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Mayor Bill de Blasio has launched a new program to get the homeless off the streets, an “If you see something, say something” plan that deputized thousands of city workers to call 311 when they see unsheltered homelessness.
      </blockquote>
      <div>
        <span class="image right" style="padding: 0 0 0 0;"><img src="{% link assets/images/nyc-2019-2.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          Under Outreach NYC, the front-line employees, from various city agencies, will be trained to request homeless outreach assistance when they come across someone in need, CBS2’s Marcia Kramer reported. The city also plans to hire 180 additional outreach workers to encourage more people to seek shelter, with a focus on empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are the men and women the mayor has enlisted in his new army to fight street homelessness — sanitation workers, building inspectors, firefighters. In all, 18,000 city workers will be trained to spot the homeless and report their location.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        “Think of it this way, whatever you do during your day as part of your job,” de Blasio said. “When you are riding around the neighborhood, walking around the neighborhood, if you see someone homeless we want you to stop right there and make a call.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The workers will be trained to use a 311 app to notify a command center that can send teams to deal with the homeless. Dealing with the street homeless has proven to be one of the city’s most intractable problems. Officials estimate there are 3,500 men and women on the street at any given time, a number that seems to remain the same even though Department of Homeless Services Commissioner Steve Banks insists the city has convinced 2,200 homeless since 2016 to accept placement in a city facility.
      </p>

        There are more than 60,000 people in shelters citywide.

        Officials admitted it’s difficult for the homeless outreach workers to convince the homeless to come in out of the cold. They said sometimes it could take hundreds of attempts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Persistent progress. We’re not being dishonest in saying we’re going to promise you a rainbow,” de Blasio said.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The city’s own numbers show how difficult it is. Kramer told the mayor she looked at some numbers that indicated the outreach people had contacted 313 homeless on Tuesday, yet only 13 agreed to come in.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Thirteen in a day is actually a really good day when your dealing with folks with this level of problems,” de Blasio said.

        Banks said the homeless won’t accept services because they don’t trust government. “They’ve had bad experiences, so rebuilding the trust is what takes the daily persistence,” Banks said.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Giselle Routhier, policy director at the Coalition for the Homeless, said it’s not about building trust. “It’s a question of building housing and resources, because if you come to someone who is on the streets and say, ‘Hey, I have a viable path into housing for you,’ that in and of itself is going to help you build trust with people,” Routhier said. Routhier also claims the new program is nothing more than mass surveillance, intended to drive the homeless out of sight but not solve the problem.

        Mayor de Blasio launched a new program called Outreach NYC urging social workers and anyone to call 311 whenever they see unsheltered homelessness. Under the program, front-line employees of city agencies will be trained to request homeless outreach assistance. Additional 18- outreach workers will be hired to encourage street homeless people to seek shelters. 18,000 city workers will be trained to spot homeless and report their locations; the fighters include sanitation workers, building inspectors, and firefighters. Street homeless people are often persistent in getting help, specifically shelter housing. For instance, after contacting 313 street homeless people, only 13 agreed to come into shelters. Steven Banks, the city’s Commissioner in Social Services, claimed the persistence stemmed from continued “bad experiences” with the government hence the consistent efforts are needed to rebuild the trust. However, Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, claimed the Outreach NYC is mass surveillance intended to drive out the homeless from the streets to somewhere invisible rather than solving the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distrust and persistent resistance towards outreach workers amongst street homeless people often stem from poor conditions of the shelters. Before the innovative measure of Safe Haven by Mayor de Blasio, shelters were in horrible conditions and once led to the deaths of two toddlers. Shelters were sites of harassment and attacks between homeless people further contributing to the resistance. As shelter conditions have improved with fewer restrictions, the shelters known amongst the street homeless are different. The delivery of information will prove the main reason for resistance, increasing the likelihood of street homeless regaining the trust of the shelter system. Therefore, the successful delivery of the current state of shelter is vital.

        New residential buildings receiving financial assistance from the city will have to set aside at least 15 percent of their units for the homeless under a bill passed by the City Council Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3713966&GUID=2A26D80A-5759-445D-A16B-B0F370CA0D32&Options=&Search=" target="blank">legislation</a>, which was introduced in 2018 by Bronx Councilmember Rafael Salamanca, applies to rental buildings with more than 40 units, and is anticipated to create 1,000 new apartments for the homeless per year. The bill’s passage comes as New York City grapples with historic levels of homelessness, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-data-show-nearly-80-000-homeless-in-new-york-city-11571922000" target="blank">federal data puts at nearly 80,000 people</a>. The provision will take effect July 2020.

        <p>
          “This is a revolutionary change in policy that is both necessary, right, and urgent,” Council Speaker Corey Johnson said during Thursday’s vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mayor Bill de Blasio initially objected to the bill, raising concerns about whether it would make some housing projects infeasible, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/nyregion/homeless-housing-nyc.html" target="blank">agreed to support the measure last week</a> after revisions were made narrowing the scope of projects that apply. The mayor has faced mounting criticism that his housing plan to build or preserve 300,000 affordable units by 2026 doesn’t do enough to help homeless New Yorkers transition into permenant housing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Other cities already have similar requirements in place; Boston, for example, mandates city-funded projects set aside at least 10 percent of those apartments for the homeless. The New York City provision will be key in combating homelessness across the five boroughs, say advocates.
      </p>
      <p>
        “At its core, it legislates that government must serve the needs of the people,” said Nathylin Flowers Adesegun, a homeless advocate with grassroots group <a href="http://www.vocal-ny.org/" target="blank">Vocal-NY</a>, whose <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/homeless-woman-asks-de-blasio-housing-help-ymca" target="blank">confrontation with Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> on housing for the homeless at the Park Slope YMCA went viral last year. “This victory is historic and will change the lives of thousands.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Costs associated with the bill are still being ironed out. Johnson and Salamanca noted that city subsidies will increase for projects the law applies to, saying that additional funds will differ “project by project.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Salamanca has already negotiated these set asides in housing projects rising in his district, securing 121 apartments for the homeless. He said Thursday that a citywide approach is key to making a meaningful dent in supplying permanent homes for New Yorkers in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The city needs policy with teeth,” said Salamanca. “And if we were truly going to address the citywide issue, it was critical that every borough and every community did their part.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this week de Blasio unveiled a plan to <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2019/12/17/21026637/nyc-end-street-homelessness-housing-shelters" target="blank">“end street homelessness as we know it”</a> within five years by creating 1,000 new permanent apartments and 1,000 additional “Safe Haven” shelter beds. Johnson called the plan an important step but said a focus on permanent, affordable housing will truly address the root of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think the mayor’s plan is good on Safe Haven, but we need to see more permanent, supportive housing built in New York City,” said Johnson in advance of Thursday’s vote. “That is the only thing that’s going to turn the tide here.”

        Under new legislation in 2018 by Bronx Councilmember Rafael Salamanca, residential buildings receiving financial assistance from the city will have to reserve at least 15 percent of the units for the homeless. Residential buildings with more than 40 units will be subject to the legislation. 1,000 more apartments will be built per year for the homeless, effective from July 2020. With a record high statistic of 80,000 homeless, the intervention is deemed “both necessary, right and urgent,” according to Council Speaker Corey Johnson. Mayor Bill de Blasio initially objected to the intervention as he worried it would make some housing projects infeasible, after a revision to narrow the scope of the project, the mayor agreed to the measure. With the promise to create 300,000 more affordable housing units for the homeless, de Blasio has been under public scrutiny for not providing transition services for the homeless. However, homeless advocate Nathylin Flowers Adesegun claimed the legislation is a historic victory that “will change the lives of thousands.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The innovative legislation ensures enough units will be provided as permanent housing for homeless New Yorkers. The biggest obstacle de Blasio currently faces is finding space for shelter and permanent housing as town residents often voiced out their concerns about having homeless people in their town and apartments. To better integrate homeless people in the shelter and permanent housing into the apartment and town, the town resident’s concerns need to be heard and solved. The concerns stemmed from safety and requested for screening processes of the homeless population. Better screening for ex-convicted felons and drug abusers will prevent the residents from fearing if they will be safe in their apartments. Although the legislation provides enough room for both permanent and temporary shelters, transition services, and programs to prevent the homeless from becoming homeless again needs to be accompanied to break the cycle of homelessness.

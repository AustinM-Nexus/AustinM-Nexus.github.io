        <h3>Hawaii re-testing 1st coronavirus death, homeless sweeps end</h3>

        <p>
          HONOLULU — Hawaii said officials recorded its first death from COVID-19, but later said they were re-evaluating test results.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        State officials late Monday said the person had multiple underlying health conditions, and the available history of the person suggests they had a potential indirect travel-related exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, state Health Director Bruce Anderson said there were “procedural issues” with the test. “We should have conclusive results on that before the end of the day,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        After announcing the death, officials learned of irregularities in the processing of the sample, Anderson said. “Just to be sure that we got the right result, we do want to run the test again and make sure that this is in fact a positive.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials didn’t release many details about the person who died, including age or gender, and only said the person lived on Oahu.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, 90 people in Hawaii have tested positive for the coronavirus. Most were on Oahu, and most were infected while traveling out of state or after close contact with someone who had traveled, authorities said.

          In other developments: HOMELESS SWEEPS SUSPENDED
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Honolulu suspended its sweeps of homeless people on Sunday in response to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, city spokesman Alexander Zannes said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The agency has recommended that authorities not clear homeless people unless housing units are available for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CDC suggests that people sleeping outside set up tents with at least 12 feet (3.6 meters) by 12 feet (3.6 meters) of space per person and that nearby restrooms have functional water taps, soap and toilet paper. It recommends that officials provide portable latrines and hand-washing facilities for encampments of more than 10 people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honolulu had closed the bathrooms at its public parks, but said it would reopen them beginning Wednesday. Other park facilities will remain closed.
      </p>

          PUBLIC SCHOOL CLOSURE EXTENDED
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The state Department of Education said it’s extending the closure of public schools through April 30 instead of bringing students back on April 7. The department is providing “grab-and-go” takeout meals at some school campuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools and teachers will be sending information to parents about online resources and instructional packets for learning. Schools are working toward providing accommodations for special education students.

          DISEMBARKING CRUISE SHIP PASSENGERS
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Passengers continued to disembark from a cruise ship in Honolulu that’s been rejected by other ports.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Norwegian Jewel remained docked at Honolulu Harbor Tuesday, as its 2,000 passengers disembark for buses that will take them to chartered flights at the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last flight is anticipated to depart Tuesday night, said Tim Sakahara, spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Coordinating the movement of 2,000 passengers from around the world requires tremendous logistics and involvement from federal, state and private agencies and we appreciate the support from everyone working to make it happen successfully,” Sakahara said in an email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawaii officials initially said cruise ship passengers would be allowed to disembark and then changed their minds and said the ship could only refuel and resupply in Honolulu. As the Norwegian Cruise Line ship, which needs repairs, neared Honolulu on Sunday, Hawaii officials said all passengers would be allowed to leave to go straight to the airport to take chartered flights home.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no cases of coronavirus on the ship, but passengers are undergoing medical screening, including thermal scanning before boarding buses to the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other cruise ships — with no passengers — are planning to enter Honolulu Harbor for fuel and provisions, the state Department of Transportation said. Crew members will remain on the vessels while at port.

        In light of the first death from COVID-19, the state of Hawaii declared a suspension on all of its sweeps of homeless encampments as a response to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has recommended to municipal authorities not to clear the homeless people unless housing units are available for them. In the new CDC guidelines for homeless people, people sleeping outside should set up their tents with at least 12 feet by 12 feet of space per person, and has added additional guidelines for restroom use, requiring functional water taps, soap, and toilet paper. For encampments of more than 10 people, the CDC recommends officials provide portable latrines and hand-washing facilities to mitigate the spread of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coronavirus pandemic affects the homeless population in a fundamentally different way in that social distancing and quarantining becomes much more of a challenge to those who live without homes. The homeless have often relied on public spaces and service centers to survive, and with Honolulu closing public bathrooms and other park facilities, the homeless face difficulty in maintaining even the daily necessities of life. While the decision is to protect the vulnerable health of the homeless and contain the spread of the disease, the unintended strain on the lives of the homeless should be considered as well. It is an applaudable move for the CDC to suspend sweeps on camps for right now to ease the disproportionate burden on the homeless.

        <h3>Coronavirus In Hawaii: Ige Orders Hawaii Residents To Stay At Home</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2020.03.23</p>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The order follows similar mandates by the mayors of Maui and Honolulu counties — and it’s an action legislative leaders have been pushing for the last few days.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Gov. David Ige ordered residents statewide to stay at home Monday in the government’s most recent effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order will take effect Wednesday and run through April 30. Nonessential business operations must cease and out-of-home travel will be restricted except under certain instances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ige’s order is similar to those imposed Sunday in Maui County and the City and County of Honolulu. It also mirrors actions taken by at least five other states operating under similar “Stay At Home” orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The threat of COVID-19 is unprecedented,” Ige said.  “It requires more aggressive action.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ige’s announcement comes a day after the Legislature sent him a letter saying he has not done enough to halt the spread of COVID-19. The letter asked that he order residents to shelter in place immediately, which is something he can do under the state’s Emergency Management Act.

          <i>Gov. David Ige signed a “Stay At Home” order Monday.</i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Essential businesses include healthcare facilities, grocery stores, pharmacies, schools, food service establishments, cannabis producers, organizations that provide charitable services such as food banks, media, gas stations, banks, hardware stores, shipping companies, post offices, laundromats, business supply stores, transportation companies, home based care services, elderly homes, child care services, labor unions, hotels, mortuaries, government functions, and critical trades including construction, plumbers, electricians, janitors, movers and engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professional firms that provide legal and accounting services and insurance companies can also stay open.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Residents can leave their homes to buy groceries, go to court, travel to work, exercise and walk their pets. Homeless individuals are exempt from the stay at home order, but are urged to find shelter space.
      </p>
      <p>
        The governor also ordered the closing of anywhere people can gather like gyms, amusement parks and theaters.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We can only be successful if everyone takes responsibility for their actions,” Ige said.
      </p>
      <p>
        U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz applauded the actions of the state and the counties.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think the measures that the mayors and the governor are putting in place have been demonstrated to work elsewhere. The whole community is coming together here,” he said. “This is going to be an extraordinarily difficult time for the state of Hawaii, but we’re now doing the things that are necessary to save lives and hopefully make sure that we come out of this as healthy and as soon as possible.”

      <p>
        Maui County and Oahu have similar stay at home orders effective Monday afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ige said he chose Wednesday as the effective date to give the state time to implement the order. He also called again for tourists to cancel their trips to Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ige said his administration had already considered making such an order before the county mandates on Sunday.

        </span>
        <p>
          Senate President Ron Kouchi, one of the lawmakers who had criticized Ige’s apparent slow movement on ordering residents to stay at home, praised the governor’s decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This action is a huge sacrifice that we could have never imagined a year ago, but we must face this challenge,” Kouchi said in a written statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning Thursday, travelers to Hawaii and returning residents must quarantine in either their homes or hotel rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state and its counties have taken steps over the last week to control and contain the virus.

        Ige on Tuesday directed bars and clubs to close and restaurants to move to takeout and drive-through service.

        Hawaii County has yet to close eateries, but has closed beach parks.

        The governor of Hawaii ordered a mandatory stay-at-home order to its residents in its efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The order will make only essential businesses to operate and restrict out-of-home travel, which will take effect from March through the end of April. With Hawaii’s total case of the coronavirus rising daily, the aggressive containment measure can only be seen as appropriate. While residents can still leave their homes to conduct essential services, such as buying groceries, going to court, going to work, exercising, or walking their pets, other non-essential activities will be restricted under certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are some people who are exempt from the stay at home order: the homeless. Homeless individuals, who literally do not have a home to stay at, will not be able to follow the stay-at-home order, and this can create a serious threat on not only the health of the homeless but also the community at large. While the state urges homeless individuals to find shelter space to quarantine in, the homeless have long struggled to find shelter or housing, and it will only get harder for them to find shelter space during times of a global pandemic. The state must ramp up on its efforts to provide enough shelter space to all unsheltered homeless individuals and although keeping encampments has not been a preferred option, the state should encourage people living in encampments to remain where they are while increasing the space between the camps and providing more hygiene resources. Because many of the health guidelines to prevent the virus are often inapplicable for a person experiencing homelessness, special consideration to the homeless will have to be taken in order to contain the virus for the community at large.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That’s what makes homeless people particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. Almost 200,000 people live in those conditions in the United States, according to a White House report, with Washington state, California and Oregon among the states most affected by homelessness as income inequality grows and housing costs rise.

            Reporters and photographers work at the site in South Seattle where King County will be placing several temporary housing units like the one shown here to house patients undergoing treatment and isolation in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus.
          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          And — in a possible recipe for disaster — the new virus has hit hardest on the West Coast, where nearly all of the nation’s more than a dozen deaths have occurred. Health officials have not yet reported coronavirus outbreaks among homeless populations, but tuberculosis and other diseases have swept through them in the past, underscoring their vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet few communities that are trying to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have rolled out plans to protect the homeless and give them a place to recover in isolation, which would prevent them from passing it on.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They are double risk. One is a risk to themselves, the other is a risk to society,” said Chunhuei Chi, director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University in Corvallis.
        </p>
        <p>
          King County, which includes Seattle and has seen most of the deaths in the U.S., is one of the few places that’s taken action: installing more than a dozen module units where infected homeless people can recover, some on county-owned land flanked by apartment buildings. The units, roughly the size of a mobile home that accommodate several people, were previously used by oil workers in Texas. County officials also bought a motel where coronavirus patients can recover in isolation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That approach needs to be replicated in many more places, said Chi, who has been closely following the global outbreak that originated in China.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This should be treated as an emergency policy, not as a permanent solution to homelessness, but more of framing it as a solution for containing the spread,” Chi said.
      </p>
      <p>
        San Francisco says it’s developing a plan to protect the homeless from the virus but hasn’t released details yet. A cruise ship believed to be a breeding ground for more than 10 cases has been lingering off the coast of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        San Francisco postponed an event Thursday at a major arena that was to provide community services for the homeless. It typically draws up to 1,000 people and was delayed to reduce the risk of exposing the homeless population to coronavirus “because they are older as a group and typically have multiple chronic medical conditions,” the city said in a statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farther south, in Los Angeles County, the health department is sending teams to over 300 homeless facilities to ensure people are washing their hands and not sharing food or utensils, department director Barbara Ferrer said. She’s urging shelters to prepare large spaces to isolate those who may become sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Health officials in the nation’s most populous county also are planning for a possible large-scale quarantine of homeless people in case the virus spreads, and will deploy street teams to work with those living in encampments to get people with symptoms treated.

            Homeless people crowd a sidewalk in downtown Salem, Ore., where they have set up a makeshift camp. Experts say that the homeless, who often have health and substance-abuse problems, are exposed to the elements and do not have easy access to hygiene, are more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Some cities are making provisions so the homeless who contract the virus have a place to recover without spreading the infection further.
          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Ferrer noted that health officials tell people to stay home when they’re sick, to wash their hands often and call their doctors with concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          “My heart goes out to the fact that they live in conditions that make it almost impossible for them,” she said of the homeless Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Oregon’s capital city, where a makeshift homeless camp has sprouted up on downtown Salem sidewalks, an agency that aids the homeless is bringing in hand-washing stations.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The homeless population in our community would be in a very difficult position of following all the health care advice that’s coming out right now,” said Jimmy Jones, executive director of the agency Community Action. “If you’re in a homeless camp, it’s very difficult to wash your hands. It’s very difficult to stay clean. It’s very difficult to practice good hygiene.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A homeless man in a long gray coat who was walking along a sidewalk in Salem said he is not particularly worried about the coronavirus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, the man, who would only give his first name, Alex, and his age, 33, asked what areas it had spread to and how quickly it progresses in an infected person.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I thought it could have been quarantined over in China maybe and didn’t know how much it would spread before they had it all figured out,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of being more vulnerable to the virus, he thought younger homeless people might be better able to fight it off.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Their immune systems have already been tested more than most people,” Alex said. “In general, I would think they might be less susceptible, unless it’s an elderly homeless person.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Experts, though, say the homeless are more vulnerable because so many have underlying health conditions. So did many patients who have died.

        Jones, the homeless advocate, said hepatitis C, heart disease and diabetes are prevalent among many of the 1,400 people who sleep on the streets, in cars or abandoned buildings, or in the woods and fields in Salem.

        “If they get this particular virus, there’s a high degree of probability it’s going to impact them more severely than it does the general population, with a higher mortality,” Jones said.

        COVID-19 may have found its best carrier to spread the disease: the homeless. Because homeless people often lack the proper hygiene resources to wash their hands and follow the state’s guidance on social distancing, they are especially vulnerable to catching the coronavirus and spreading it as well. Many health experts believe that with a recent rise in homelessness due to growing income inequality and housing costs, the coronavirus can be a recipe for disaster if an outbreak were to happen among the homeless population. While some cities and states have tried to contain the spread of the virus by introducing new shelters, many are concerned that there just aren’t enough isolated spaces to contain all of the people on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The homeless population pose a double risk, in that they carry the risk of contracting the virus themselves, as well as spreading the virus to the society. Emergency measures should be taken as quickly as possible to mitigate the effects of the disease, because the virus is likely to spread quickly and fatally in the homeless communities, where people are in close quarters with many having underlying conditions. The state of Hawaii should model after measures taken by other municipalities, such as creating mobile housing units and even converting places like hotels and public facilities into temporary housing units for the homeless to isolate themselves in. While these measures have been criticized in the past for their ineffectiveness in addressing homelessness, with a global pandemic in the picture, the state must take emergency action to come up with a solution for containing the spread of the virus as a top priority.

        <h3>Cops forced a homeless man to choose between licking a urinal or going to jail, then tried to cover it up</h3>

        But John Rabago, a Honolulu police officer, waved a get-out-of-jail-free card. He told 37-year-old Samuel Ingall that he could avoid arrest — but only if he was willing to humiliate himself and potentially expose himself to all kinds of alarming bacteria in the process.

          <i>
            Former Honolulu police officer Reginald Ramones, shown here in September, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge that he knew fellow officer John Rabago committed a civil rights violation but didn't inform authorities about it. Rabago pleaded guilty on Monday to depriving a homeless man of his civil rights by forcing him to lick a public urinal.
          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          The January 2018 confrontation sparked a federal investigation that concluded on Monday, when Rabago, 43, pleaded guilty to conspiring to deprive Ingall of his civil rights. Though the cop had initially claimed his comments were a joke that got misconstrued, a former Honolulu police officer, Reginald Ramones, also 43, who pleaded guilty in September and promised to testify against Rabago, said that the threat was entirely serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Ingall evidently took it literally: He reluctantly agreed to lick the public toilet so that he could avoid going to jail, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/427499585/Ramones-Plea-Agreement#from_embed" target="blank">prosecutors say</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The homeless man made a habit of cleaning up in one particular public bathroom in a busy Honolulu shopping district. He was there so often that a sympathetic employee would unlock the bathroom for him, Hawaii News Now reported. But on Jan. 28, 2018, someone objected to his presence and called the police with a nuisance complaint.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Rabago was the first of five officers to show up. In court on Monday, he said that Ingall was uncooperative and gave him a fake name, while telling him that he would do anything to avoid being arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relatives of Ingall have said that he struggles with drug addiction and has been in and out of jail for most of his adult life. A 2016 documentary about Hawaii’s homelessness crisis captured him being released from prison and promising to turn his life around. “I’m ready to work immediately,” he told the camera crew. “I don’t want to risk going back to prison and selling drugs on the street.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ingall checked into a homeless shelter, the documentary showed, but within a matter of days, he was hospitalized after overdosing on crystal meth. His family told Hawaii News Now that he had been let out into the street “with no ID, nothing,” after his release from prison, making it impossible for him to apply for permanent housing. His mother suggested that he could have avoided petty disputes with police if he was receiving the help that he needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his January 2018 run-in with the Honolulu Police Department, Ingall reportedly told his sisters that the officers had forced him to sit in urine and shoved his head into the toilet. “He says he wasn’t resisting arrest,” Mary Ingall told Hawaii News Now. “They hit him with a stick on his left arm. He has a big bruise.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In Rabago’s plea agreement, he acknowledged that he repeatedly told Ingall, “in an aggressive tone,” that the only way he wasn’t getting arrested was if he licked the urinal. By then, Ramones had arrived on the scene, and Rabago told him to close the door behind him. Then, he repeated his order again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ingall “reluctantly knelt down before the urinal” and licked it, the plea agreement states. Rabago allowed him to gather his possessions and go, then followed him out of the bathroom. He laughed as he told the other officers waiting outside about what he made the homeless man do.
      </p>
      <p>
        “He was forced to essentially do something that’s disgusting,” Myles Breiner, Ingall’s attorney, told KHON in April. “His face was forced into a urinal. The police officers thought this was amusing. It wasn’t as though he was doing anything illegal but they chose to do this to him because he was vulnerable.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The homeless man didn’t come forward to tell authorities about what happened. But one of the officers who had been waiting outside the bathroom informed his bosses, sparking a federal investigation, Hawaii News Now reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        “That officer should be commended,” Honolulu Police Commission Chairwoman Loretta Sheehan told the outlet. “As a member of the public, I thank him or her from the bottom of my heart. This is the kind of stuff we need to continue to do at HPD to maintain the highest level of integrity there.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Rabago and Ramones were arrested last April and pleaded not guilty. Megan Kau, Rabago’s attorney, told KHON in April that the officers had been “joking around” when they made a comment about licking a toilet bowl and that the other officer “took it the wrong way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But Ingall’s family maintained that he was telling the truth. “We know our brother. We know when he lies. We know when he’s being dishonest,” his sister, Mary Ingall, told Hawaii News Now. “And he was very sincere and very detailed and it never changed, what he said.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In September, Ramones changed his tune, pleading guilty to a lesser charge of withholding information about a crime, and promised to testify against Rabago in court. In his plea agreement, he detailed how his former co-worker told him to shut the bathroom door so that the incident wouldn’t be captured by a security camera, and said that Rabago later instructed him to delete their text messages and coached him on how to lie to investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ramones also said that before the January 2018 incident, he watched Rabago confront another man in the bathroom of a public park, telling him that unless he stuck his head in the toilet, he would be arrested. The man reluctantly agreed, he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kau told Hawaii News Now on Monday that Rabago was “very remorseful, which is why he took responsibility.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Both defendants are slated to be sentenced in February and face fines up to $250,000. Ramones, who reportedly left the Honolulu Police Department in August, could be sentenced to up to three years in prison, though the government is expected to recommend he only receive <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/09/25/breaking-news/former-honolulu-police-officer-pleads-guilty-to-forcing-homeless-man-to-lick-urinal/" target="blank">probation</a>. Rabago faces up to 10 years in prison. According to Hawaii News Now, he is on leave from the Honolulu Police Department and expects to be fired now that the case has concluded.

        A recent incident between a Honolulu police officer and a homeless man in Hawaii has sparked shock and controversy for its deprivation of basic civil rights. After a federal investigation, John Rabago, a Honolulu police officer, pleaded guilty to telling the homeless man that he could avoid arrest if he was willing to humiliate himself by licking the urinal in a public bathroom. While he denied charges as a joke at first, his colleague testified against him, saying that he was entirely real. The homeless man knelt down and reluctantly agreed to lick the public toilet so that he could avoid going to jail, which showed that he took the statement literally and seriously, given the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shocking incident can be seen as a serious violation of civil rights for the homeless and a revolting abuse of power from authorities. The homeless are often deprived of their basic civil rights for just being homeless, and although not all police officers behave like Rabago, many homeless people testify that they are often treated with excessive force and threat even when they are not resisting arrest. This could be attributed to Hawaii’s recent policies which intend on criminalizing the homeless for lodging and blocking street walks, which has already been pointed out to be potentially unconstitutional for infringing on the basic rights of the homeless. While it is promising news that Rabogo will face fine and jail time, the Honolulu police should be trained and educated on how to deal with the homeless, who are already often vulnerable and mentally unstable, so that they avoid any incidents like this which deprive them of their basic civil rights.

          HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - As many as 373 in five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s the number of unsheltered homeless who died on Oahu from 2014 to 2018, according to the Honolulu Medical Examiner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Alexander, the city Office of Housing’s executive director, said the statistics were “startling” and showed that “our streets and other public areas are not fit for human habitation."
        </p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        “I was really surprised at the number of people who died unsheltered,” Alexander said.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The cause of death for a third of those who died was listed as substance abuse, suicide or homicide.

        </span>
        <p>
          “Compared to Oahu’s general population, those who are homeless have a higher rate of death from drug abuse, infectious diseases, and in far too many instances, they fall victim to homicide,” said Honolulu Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s clear from the data that we gathered that living on the streets leads to an early death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the number of homeless deaths per year from 2014:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>2018: 90</li>
          <li>2017: 70</li>
          <li>2016: 78</li>
          <li>2015: 63</li>
          <li>2014: 72</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The average age of death among this vulnerable population was 52.6 years, well below the current life expectancy in the U.S. of 78.6 years old. In Hawaii, the average life expectancy is more than 80 years old.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        “We knew this was an issue last year in December when we had a memorial for those that died on the street,” Alexander said. “Usually mental health isn’t the city’s purview, it’s the state’s, but we’re stepping in and working together with them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Pamela Witty-Oakland, the director for the city Department of Community Services, said it’s critical to house individuals because “you cannot get well on the street.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think we should be addressing homelessness in addition to the housing programs, and we need to address it from the health care perspective,” Witty-Oakland said.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the programs the city is using to put more people in permanent housing is Outreach Navigation, which Alexander says is focusing particularly on “providing psychiatric services on the street for people who are experiencing mental illness or substance abuse disorder.”
      </p>

        </span>
        <p>
          Witty-Oakland, meanwhile, said tackling the unsheltered homeless problem on Oahu is everyone’s responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s all about community partnership,” Witty-Oakland said, adding she has been asking people to step up and be a part of their church organizations or go through their employers to volunteer at homeless clinics.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We have groups who step up to volunteer at Sand Island all the time,” Witty-Oakland said. “I realize how sick, ill and vulnerable these individuals are with both physical and mental illness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She said there is a direct connection between lack of hygiene and premature death.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Places like the Punawai Rest Stop on Kuwili St., Witty-Oakland said, have been more than willing to take in hygiene products such as toothbrushes and paper towels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alexander also said the city was trying to help people “help themselves when they can.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In a news release, Mayor Kirk Caldwell called statistics “a sobering wake-up call," and said a main priority is to get the homeless population into shelter and off the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caldwell said the city’s approach of “compassionate disruption,” which began in 2014, is another way to help decrease the number of homeless people in the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under “compassionate disruption,” the city has sought to move homeless people from parks, sidewalks and bus stops while also bolstering homeless programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        “As an island community that believes in the principle of ‘aloha,’ true compassion is helping people into stable shelter and supportive housing where their health needs can be addressed,” Alexander said.

        There has been an alarming number of unsheltered homeless people who died on Oahu from 2014 to 2018, where numbers showed as many as 373 in the past five years. According to the city Office of Housing, these numbers are truly startling and show that the unsheltered homeless population should be addressed as a priority, because so many homeless people die unsheltered. The cause of death for a third of those who died was substance abuse, suicide, or homicide, showing that the living conditions on the streets are not made for human habitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this data, officials found that living on the streets often lead to an early death, pointing a new direction for future policy efforts. Because many homeless who die on the streets often require mental health care, the state should look for ways to work with mental health organizations and care providers, addressing the problem from not only a housing crisis perspective but also from a healthcare perspective. Making it a priority to tackle the unsheltered homeless population, the state should raise awareness on the startling number of deaths for the unsheltered homeless and encourage community partnership and participation. Fighting homelessness is everyone’s responsibility, so asking more people to step up to volunteer or raise donations can help build momentum in the state’s efforts to address the housing crisis as well as the homeless crisis.

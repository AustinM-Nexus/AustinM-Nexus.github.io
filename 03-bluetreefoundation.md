        The Blue Tree Foundation, also known as The Foundation for Preventing Youth Violence (FPYV) is a nonprofit organization established by a father who lost his only son due to the damages of school violence in 1995. FPYV was established as South Korea’s first ever nonprofit organization to prevent school violence. FPYV’s purpose is to promote the seriousness of school violence to society and to provide treatment for victims. FPYV is a youth NGO that has been granted special consultative status by the UN Economic and Social Council.

      <p>
        There was a 16-year-old boy who had many dreams. He was always confident and had many friends around him. However, school violence entirely changed his life. He became insecure and his friends left him. He had no choice but to pray for nothing bad happens day by day rather than dreaming of a brighter future. In the end, he decided to commit suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a father who had an adorable 16-year-old son. He was so proud of his son and people around him envied the father and son. But the death of his son changed his entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The father was filled with grief and anger after his son’s death. He spent every day in tears. However, he hoped that there would be no more children suffering from school violence like his son and no more miserable fathers who losing their children because of school violence. Thus, he laid the whole thing out and decided to start a new life. FPYV was established on the purpose of helping children who are losing their dreams because of school violence to dream of better futures. FPYV supports and stands on the same side of the children by holding their hands. The Father’s pledge that he won’t lose his hold of children in the same situation made FPYV possible to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who agree with his heartfelt effort are gathered and they had supported for children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, the world doesn't ignore the school violence anymore. However, there are children who are still suffering from school violence. These days, school violence is getting more sophisticated. So, many children around us are deeply hurt and distressed by school violence. FPYV wants to protect our children so that all these children can grow in a safe environment. With our supports, children will have the freedom to dream with hope. We wish for the children to fully enjoy the happiness with a big smile.

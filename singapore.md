        <h3>Commentary: Many may be forgotten if data drives public policy</h3>

      <blockquote>

          A smart thing to do is to acknowledge that data by itself is not inherently smart and won’t automatically lead to the best solutions to social or economic problems, says one NTU observer.

      <p>
        SINGAPORE: Singapore, like many other cities around the globe, has bet heavily on “big data” as a way to drive economic development and solve urban problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is widely seen as a kind of resource – the oil of the 21st century – that can be mined to “unlock value and innovation” as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has put it. Data is now touted as a powerful resource that will solve problems in healthcare, transport, crime, education, and bring new economic opportunities.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">
          <img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2018-1.jpg %}" alt="" />
          <i>Registration counters at Punggol Polyclinic.</i>
        </span>
        <p>
          But such metaphors can be misleading. Data, unlike oil, is not something that is just sitting in the ground waiting to be collected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mostly generated by people – when we use our smartphones, ride the MRT, visit the doctor, surf the Internet or drive our cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of this data is captured by authorities including the Land Transport Authority, the Ministry of Health or other government bodies; others are sucked up by Singtel, Facebook, Google, or other private companies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But in almost all cases, data refers back to people, to us. And this means we need to be very careful how we use and interpret it. Data may not lie, but – like the people it comes from – it can be messy, incomplete and misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MISINTERPRETED, MISUSED DATA</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, for example, crime data is increasingly used to direct police to particular neighbourhoods. Famed American mathematician Cathy O’Neil has recently written about how sophisticated software such as Predpol and Hunchlab analyse crime statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Santa Cruz, California, for example, Predpol examined eleven years of data of past crimes to generate predictions about where future crimes may occur. These “hotspots” appear as red squares on a map on a computer screen. More police can now be sent to these areas.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">
          <img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2018-1-2.jpg %}" alt="" />
        </span>
        <p>
          So far, so good. But having a greater police presence in an area also means more crimes may be detected, especially petty crimes. These are then fed back into the software, making an area look even more dangerous and attracting an even greater police presence. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is that some neighborhoods end up with many more arrests and many more people being sent to jail. This is exactly what has happened in cities across the US including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That’s not fair, and it’s also not a smart use of data – it amplifies inequalities between groups. This could happen in Singapore too. One of the uses of big data here has been the use of locational information from our phones, collected by telcos in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns of foot traffic can be mined to find the most heavily walked areas within malls and shopping streets. This is used by retail brands to find the ideal location for their next outlet or by malls to set rental prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this kind of reasoning may contribute to a vicious cycle in which depressed areas remain depressed, while rich areas get richer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>DATA CAN EXACERBATE INEQUALITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Directing business to high-traffic neighbourhoods means that those areas will retain good jobs; this means less money and less spending in low-traffic neighbourhoods, potentially leading to even less economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of data may exacerbate the differences between the best-served and worst-served areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now this remains a hypothetical in Singapore, but elsewhere in the world the results of big data approaches are already becoming clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, US activist Virginia Eubanks has recently exposed how data-driven systems – such as the Homeless Management Information System in Los Angeles and the predictive risk modelling Allegheny Family Screening Tool in Pennsylvania – are trapping vulnerable individuals in cycles of poverty and homelessness.

        </span>
        <p>
          If we begin to allocate public services – such as healthcare, education, public transportation – according to data, we need to make sure we’re interpreting it correctly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent news has highlighted the growing significance of big data in the healthcare sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          One report described how Fullerton Healthcare had examined data from medical transactions at public hospitals in Singapore, searching for spikes in reported cases of chronic conditions such as diabetes in particular areas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        When they found an uptick, the company tried to help areas in need by delivering health education and awareness campaigns about diet and healthy eating. In some areas, the number of medical claims dropped substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this data only captures those individuals who attended hospitals or clinics; it does not measure the actual occurrences of chronic disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are the most vulnerable may be left out of these statistics  - maybe because they find it difficult to travel to a doctor, or are worried about the costs of medical care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly the reduced number of claims is saving Fullerton money, but is it really serving the public interest?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MAKING DATA ACCESSIBLE</b>
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image right">

          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          One solution is to make data as open as possible – to let everyone see and use them. The Government’s data.gov.sg website aims to give Singaporeans access to large quantities of public data they can examine for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick glance at the portal reveals information about crime, housing, education, the economy, transport, health and many other areas. This is surely a good thing because we need as many people as possible to be aware of what data exists and participate in analysis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But opening up data does not solve every problem. We also need to know and take into account where and how data is collected and who it is collected from.
      </p>
      <p>
        If data is collected from web and smartphone users, for example, we can’t expect it to fairly represent the elderly population who are likely to use such technologies less. If data is collected from public transport, we can’t expect it to evenly reflect the whole socio-economic spectrum of Singapore, since wealthier individuals are more likely to drive, nor can we necessarily expect data to equally represent races, religions, or language groups.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">

          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Of course, all this doesn’t mean we should abandon big data. But data requires great care in its interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is not inherently smart and won’t automatically lead to the best solutions to social or economic problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to temper the enthusiasm for data with continued awareness of its limitations. This means keeping an eye on who data represents, who it includes, and who it leaves out. That's the really smart thing to do.

        Singapore, similar to other cities, has relied heavily on big data as a way of driving economic development and solving urban problems such as homelessness, education, healthcare, transport, crime, and education. Data, mostly generated by people - smartphones, MRT, surfing on the internet, and visiting the doctor - and is utilized by the authorities including the Land Transport Authority and the Ministry of Health or other government bodies. Despite its abundance and accessibility, it can be messy, incomplete, or misleading. For instance, police forces in the United States have built software based on previous arrest and crime statistics to extrapolate and predict areas that are likely to have higher crime rates than others. Based on the software, more police officers are deployed to the area leading to higher arrest - whether that be of serious crimes or petty crimes - and feeding the statistics even though the increased crimes do not require as much police effort. Hence, areas with a high crime rate garner even higher crime rate not necessarily because there has been an increase in crimes but more are being detected and arrested. Data can also exacerbate inequality as corporations direct their high-paying business to already affluent areas; this use of data remains hypothetical in Singapore but elsewhere in the world the result of inequality exacerbation is evident. Further, the use of big data to solve an urban problem may be completely misleading. In the case of healthcare, big data of previous health care usage statistics may not produce ecologically valid prediction and reflection of Singapore’s healthcare system as it only accounts for previous healthcare uses - meaning it only includes those who could afford and have used the system, but not the others. Big data reveals past trends and incidents and provides a foundation or a source the government could utilize to solve modern problems, however how the data is collected needs to be taken into consideration. The majority of data is from smartphones meaning those who cannot afford to have a phone, who do not have a phone by choice, or the elderly who may not use a phone are excluded from the bid data. Hence, keeping an eye on whom data represents, whom it includes, and whom it leaves out is vital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big data provides a useful tool for Singapore to solve its urban issues such as the homeless. It helps compile causes of homelessness, categorize it based on characteristics of the homeless such as age, ethnicity, past history, mental illness, and physical illness, aggregate the general movement of the homeless population within Singapore, and more. It provides more in-depth and detailed information on past and current homelessness; it is a vital tool and a prerequisite for increasingly data-dependent Singapore. However, the reliability and validity of the big data of homelessness in Singapore need to be assessed with critical eyes. Government involvement in producing favorable data and reducing homelessness could be possible. Measuring homelessness is also difficult as approaching the homeless and gaining in-depth information on the reasons for their homelessness is difficult. Further, tracking each homeless requires abundant and effective outreach efforts.The trends and evaluations based on the data could provide a useful tool to have a better understanding of homelessness in Singapore but where and how the data is collected as well as its potential weaknesses needs to be taken into account.

        SINGAPORE- Although they were aged only eight and nine, Rita and Alfred (not their real names) received no care or supervision and were expected to do all their family's household chores, as well as look after their four younger siblings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They loitered in the neighbourhood to beg for food and money and were caned, slapped and hit with a belt by their father - who even threw dumbbells and padlocks at them.

        </span>
        <p>
          The Ministry of Social and Family Development was alerted to their case last year and the family was referred to Safe Space, a child protection specialist centre. Today they are one of the families benefiting from its support and services. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On Tuesday (March 20), Safe Space was officially opened. It is the third child protection specialist centre set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development(MSF) and is run by Pave, a family specialist centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other two centres are Big Love run by Montfort Care and Heart @ Fei Yue run by Fei Yue Community Services.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Alfred and Rita's case is not an isolated one. Last year social workers helped 997 clients with family violence issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space helps children under 16 who are victims or witnesses of domestic violence. It handles "moderate risk" child abuses cases referred by the Child Protective Services of the MSF and the public. The centre began its operations on January 3 last year and moved into Yishun Central early this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year, Safe Space has dealt with 128 cases and about 239 enquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children are referred there by the MSF's Child Protective Services, the Family Justice Courts, as well as by relatives and members of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gracing the opening ceremony was President Halimah Yacob who said that young children who are witnesses or victims of violence find it difficult to articulate what happened to them or identify who was responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The families of these children also face multiple stressors such as unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues and matrimonial difficulties. More often than not, they lack the support of an extended family and other social networks that most of us are blessed with," she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Family violence is an issue that cuts across racial, religious and socio-economic lines. When all of us put children's safety and welfare first, and when we all work together, great change can happen for the most vulnerable children."
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space staff work closely with government organisations such as the Child Protective Service, the health system, schools, the police, legal aid, the social service system and community organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pave is Singapore's pioneer family violence specialist centre. It began as a programme initiated in 1999 by three social workers who felt that family violence needed closer attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        President of Pave, Mr Michael Gray, said: "If children have a Safe Space to have their voices heard and their feelings acknowledged, we offer them a different life journey - one that hopefully will allow them to enjoy their childhood and move on."

        Safe Space is a child protection specialist center. When potential domestic abuse and violence is reported to the Ministry of Social and Family Development, families are referred to Safe Space. Safe Space was opened on March 20th, 2018, and is the third child protections specialist center set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development and is run by Pave, a family specialist center. In 2017, social workers helped 997 clients with family violence issues. Safe Space helps chilcdren under 16 who have survived or witnesses of domestic violence and handles “moderate risk” child abuse cases referred by the Child Protectve Services. In 2018, Safe Space has dealt with 128 cases and 239 enquiries. According to Safe Space President Halimah Yacob, the children who survived or witnessed abuse face “difficulties in articulating what happened or identifying what happened … and face multiple stressors such as unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues and matrimonial difficulties.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space, and Singapore’s Child Protective Services, provides institutional connection and help to find and assess potential child abuse cases and provide shelters for the children. It provides shelter and prevents further damage and trauma the children have to endure through. When children are abused, the knee-jerk reaction of them is to blame themselves and block the memories out as a survival coping mechanism to paint the abuser in a good light - brainwashing themselves to cope with the abuse. They face difficulties in articulating what they are feeling, what happened to them are under various stressors no children should be subjected to. Further, according to Pluck et al. (2013), childhood abuse has multiple negative impacts on lifetime development such as personality disorder and substance abuse. Homelessness and child abuse have a high linear positive correlation, as well, with child abuse high in homelessness and child abuse victims in homelessness. To break the cycle of abuse and homelessness, institutions such as Safe Space and Child Protective Services need to increase its effort from reactive to proactive to send outreach workers to assess for any undetected child abuse.

        <h3>Why are there so many “elderly” homeless?</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2018.01.14</p>
      </header>
      <p>
        I refer to the article “Restaurant owner gives out blankets to those sleeping on Chinatown streets as cool weather continues” (Straits Times, Jan 13).
      </p>
      <p>
        It states that “Since last Thursday (Jan 4), the restaurant owner has been giving out blankets to those sleeping on the streets, mainly in mature estates such as Tiong Bahru, Redhill and Toa Payoh.
      </p>
      <p>
        He estimated that he has given out more than 100 blankets so far. They cost around $10 per piece.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2018-3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          In the early hours of a rainy Saturday morning (Jan 13), The Straits Times followed Mr Ng, 44, on his solo mission to do good. In about an hour, he delivered nine blankets in Chinatown to mostly elderly men. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of them lie on benches and reclining chairs, while make do with a piece of cardboard on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them was carpenter and odd-jobs worker Chua Yong Sia, 61, who has been sleeping on the streets in Chinatown for the last three to four years. He said there are about 10 to 20 people sleeping in the area every day.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Why is it that one of the richest countries in the world (according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)) with the highest Budget surplus per capita in the billions almost every year – have so many homeless who are elderly?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, arguably – it may be our “not so compassionate” public housing rental policies which may be contributing to this homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may like to try this out and experience it for yourself – when you see a homeless person – call the ComCare hotline 18002220000 (you can see posters all over Singapore encouraging you to call when you come across a needy person).
      </p>
      <p>
        What typically happens next is that the homeless person may be placed in a homeless shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, generally – the stay in a homeless shelter cannot be indefinite, and is subject to regular review – every three or six months typically.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, some of the homeless end up homeless again, and their arguably, only long term housing solution is to rent a HDB 1-room rental flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the requirements (which I understand has not changed for decades despite inflation) are that two single men of age at least 35 years old must somehow find each other, and their combined monthly income cannot exceed $1,500.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are lucky enough to find another homeless roommate whom you think you can live with – it may be quite difficult to meet the combined monthly income criteria.

        Do you agree that such “not so compassionate” policies may need to be reviewed?

        Restaurant owners give blankets to those sleeping on Chinatown streets as the cool winter approaches in Singapore. It is estimated that the owner has given out about 100 blankets so far, each costing around $10 per piece. Mr. Ng, embarked on a solo journey and managed to give out 9 blankets to the homeless in an hour. Most were elderly men. The reason for disproportionately high elderly population in the homeless demographic is likely to be “not so compassionate” public housing rental policies. When a homeless person calls for ComCare hotline, they are placed in a shelter for three or six months. Some end up homeless again which calls for a long term housing solution - renting out 1-room HDB flat. However, the requirement for HDB flat, two men or a couple of people, aged at least 35 years old, restricts any other homeless unable to find a roommate or live with a roommate systematically discriminated against from the HDF public housing scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “not so compassionate policies” are also discriminatory as it prioritizes families with children or elderly. Meaning, single men faced relatively more difficulty in receiving any help from the government although single men were the largest demographic in Singapore’s homeless population. Many homeless also recalled being “humiliated” when they called for help from social workers. This mainly stems from the importance of meritocracy and hard work in Singaporean culture. Meaning, if someone was homeless, it is because of their merit, or lack thereof. The cultural approach contributed to a lack of compassion. Once homeless were allocated into the shelter, only a small proportion of them were given transitional housing and they had to wait a long time. The system was rigid and produced a long waiting time. For Singapore to combat homelessness, not only does the waiting time need to be shortened but long affordable housing and solutions to tackle the root causes of homelessness such as training, job search, education, and mental illness support needed.

          Homelessness is a "complex issue" with many underlying causes, ranging from financial to marital and family difficulties.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said this in response to questions sent by The Straits Times about the findings of a survey done by SW101 and Montfort Care.
      </p>
      <p>
        It added that in dealing with homelessness, the Government works with various parties to address underlying issues, such as providing employment assistance, counselling to address marital and family issues, or link-ups to other services such as childcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        "MSF looks into all cases brought to our attention, to ascertain the individuals' situations. Our priority is to ensure their immediate needs are met and they receive support to address their long-term housing and living needs," it said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vulnerable individuals, such as women and children, are given immediate assistance and admitted to crisis shelters, it added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families who have exhausted all housing options may be admitted into transitional shelters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older persons who have physical or mental health conditions, no means of supporting themselves, or no family able or willing to support them are admitted to welfare homes, it said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, even as we seek to provide support to the needy in our community, there are some who prefer to be self-reliant or decline assistance for other reasons."
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, the MSF dealt with 269 cases of homelessness, which it defined to be people with no means of accommodation. Its figures exclude those who have a home but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes or other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the 269 cases, 93 were of families who went into transitional shelters, and 176 were of individuals who went into transitional shelters or welfare homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, MSF dealt with 296 cases.

        According to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), homelessness is a “complex issue” with many underlying causes, ranging from financial to marital and family difficulties. The government works with various parties to address issues such as providing employment assistance, counseling, and a network of service institutions such as childcare. MSK looks into all cases to ascertain the individual’s situations and customize help plans to ensure immediate needs are met then support systems are given to address their long-term and living needs. Further, vulnerable individuals such as women and children are given immediate assistance and admitted to crisis shelters. Families who have exhausted all remaining housing options are admitted to transitional housing. MSF defined homelessness as people with no means of accommodations which excludes those who have a home but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes and other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homelessness is a diverse and complex issue with dynamic, complex, and diverse underlying causes. A reason for the homelessness of an individual may be a combination of personal, mental, physical, reasons on a microscale, macro reasons such as increasing rents and living costs, increasing low-wage working and competition, and relationship-based reasons such as family disputes. Hence, trying to solve homelessness through a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach will not be effective. Although MSF, claims to, assess each case of homelessness to gain in-depth verstehen and insights as to what the unique combinations of reasons for homelessness are and offer appropriate help, the method excludes people who may have a home - as the definition of homelessness is those without means of accommodation. To ensure an ecologically valid population is covered and given helps, the definition of homelessness needs to encompass inclusive meanings of homelessness.

        <h3>180 found sleeping on streets</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2017.10.07</p>

        <p>Volunteers find many of them have jobs and do not fit stereotypes of homeless people</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Over a five-hour stretch, 100 volunteers found 180 people sleeping outdoors across 25 locations in Singapore. Most were men aged above 50, and a good proportion had jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This point-in-time survey is believed to be the first of its kind here. It was done in March by volunteer welfare organisation Montfort Care and volunteer group SW101, which focuses on issues facing low-income individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the 180 people, 84 answered some or all of the survey questions, which ranged from personal particulars, like age and educational background, to home ownership. The rest declined or were already asleep. Those sleeping outdoors were found mainly in parks such as East Coast Park and at HDB blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exercise, conducted from 9pm to 2am, also revealed that 21 had been sleeping outdoors for more than a year, and 18 for more than five years.
      </p>

            Of the 180 people found sleeping outdoors by volunteers over a five-hour period in March, 21 had been sleeping outdoors for more than a year and 18 for more than five years.
          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe, who is part of the research effort, said he was alarmed by how long people were sleeping in public. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "You would think that if people were sleeping outside, if these were the numbers and if it has been happening for so long, we would have noticed. I think it reminds us how invisible they often are," said Prof Ng, who is from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That 60 per cent of them were working - 58 per cent full-time, 38 per cent in casual employment - was another finding that surprised the team. Most of those with jobs were cleaners or security guards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A quarter of those surveyed have a registered address, often a rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The homeless people found did not fit stereotypes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Said Prof Ng: "They are able-bodied, and they are actually holding down jobs - just not very rewarding jobs. The low wages are a reminder of the work issues that a particular segment of the population faces."
      </p>
      <p>
        The point-in-time count methodology is common in the United States and Britain, where it is used to monitor homeless populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        When The Straits Times visited Chinatown late on Monday night, there were people sleeping across plastic chairs, on cardboard laid out on benches, and with their heads down on the tables of 24-hour coffee shops. One, slumped on the table in a coffee shop, said he has a job clearing tables at People's Park Complex.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>KEY FINDINGS</b>
        <p>
          Members of SW101, a volunteer group of social workers and academics, and staff from charity Montfort Care found 180 people sleeping on the streets here. They were conducting a street survey to find out how many people were sleeping in public and therefore might be homeless. These are the key findings of their survey:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>61 per cent were aged 50 and older; 24 per cent were in their 20s to 40s.</li>
          <li>88 per cent were men.</li>
          <li>Of the 84 who answered a question on their marital status, 40 per cent said they were single.</li>
          <li>23 out of 84 had an HDB flat in their name - 15 were rental flats and five were purchased.</li>
          <li>48 out of 80 who answered about their employment were employed.</li>
          <li>
            Of the 74 who answered a question on their education level, 53 per cent said they had primary school education or less, 40 per cent had secondary school education, 8 per cent had post-secondary certificates or diplomas.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) clarified that some may have homes but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes, or because they are shift workers who want to be near their workplaces. MSF said it assists in about 300 homeless cases each year - which it defined as people who have no means of accommodation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But while the Government can house them in shelters, some prefer the freedom of living on the streets, said Mr Abraham Yeo, 35, founder of volunteer group Homeless Hearts, which befriends the homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prof Ng's team also found that, in the past year, none of those sleeping on the streets had asked for help from shelters, and less than 20 per cent had sought help from friends and family, MPs and the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development, said measures are in place to help the homeless find shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hoped people can encourage those sleeping in public to seek help. "We should be concerned for the homeless for their security and well-being, regardless of the reasons for them not going home," he said. "Only with proper shelter can they set about rebuilding their lives."
      </p>
      <p>
        Prof Ng suggested one way forward is for outreach efforts and shelter services to be expanded. But it is important for the public to first understand the challenges faced by the homeless: "When the public is not aware of the problem, our society cannot begin to address it properly."

        Over a five-hour search by 100 volunteers found 180 people sleeping outdoors across 25 locations in Singapore. Most were men aged above 50 and had jobs. The search is first of its kind and was conducted by a volunteer welfare organization called Montfort Care and SW101 which focuses on issues low-income individuals face. Out of 150, 60 percent of them worked. Amongst the 60 percent, 58 percent had a full-time job and 38 percent were in casual employment. A quarter of the survey respondents had a registered address - often a rental flat under Joint Singles Scheme. Assistant Professor Ng Ko Hoe, a part of the research effort, commented on the demographic being “able-bodied … actually holding down jobs - just not rewarding jobs.” Professor Ng commented the low wages are a “reminder of the work issues that the particular segment of the population faces.”

      <p>
        The point-in-time count methodology was first used in Singapore to track the homeless. The methodology provides quantitative insights of general trends in the homeless population and the main areas the homeless population inhabit in Singapore - hence, incorporating it more to annually track the homeless population would better prepare the government and non-profit organizations from setting the size-specific and location-specific policies. The fact that it was used for the first time reflects how not prepared and equipped Singapore is to track homeless statistics. The Singapore government must incorporate the measure to quantitatively track down the demographic. Further, the survey population contradicts the general consensus of stereotypes of homeless people - lazy and jobless. To solve homelessness, providing opportunities and interventions to increase their wages such as through job training and job searching could increase their wages and better prepare them to rent out a flat.

        <h3>State Of Homelessness In Singapore</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2020.08.13</p>
      </header>
      <p>
        <b>QUESTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Zainal Sapari MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC
      </p>
      <p>
        To ask the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what has been the extent of the problem of homelessness in Singapore in the last three years; (b) whether there has been an in-depth study or research done to look into this complex phenomenon; and (c) what are the short-term and long-term plans to minimise the problem of homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>ANSWER</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Low-income persons who have no family support and cannot afford to purchase a flat, may apply for HDB's public rental housing or may be assisted with Interim Rental Housing. Those who have exhausted all housing options and require social work intervention to address their underlying issues can be admitted to MSF-funded transitional shelters. Individuals who are destitute, with no family support and no means of supporting themselves, may be admitted to welfare homes. Between 2015 and 2017, MSF assisted an average of 385 such cases each year. These include referrals by MSF patrol teams, police officers, or social and healthcare agencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Besides temporary accommodation, social workers at transitional shelters work with shelter residents to address their underlying issues, such as employment, financial and family issues, and to secure long-term housing arrangements. The welfare homes provide care and rehabilitation programmes for destitute persons to improve their physical and emotional well-being, and where possible re-integrate them into the community again.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are also individuals who have homes but sleep in public for various reasons. For instance, they may have disputes with family members or co-tenants, or wish to be closer to their workplaces due to lack of transport options from home. Most of the persons sleeping in public whom MSF's patrol teams come across fall into these categories.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have found that families in transitional housing often experienced divorce and financial difficulties. Many had sold their flats and spent their monies to clear debts or for other purposes before becoming homeless. It is thus important to provide holistic support and intervention across relevant agencies to address the families' issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          MSF works closely with Government agencies and community partners to address homelessness. A key thrust is upstream support to enable individuals to access and remain in HDB housing. We are strengthening inter-agency coordination with HDB, social service agencies and community groups to do this. As family conflict and stresses are often linked to homelessness, social workers play an important role in addressing the root causes. MSF will also continue to review and enhance the effectiveness of the shelter models to help homeless families and individuals regain stability and access stable housing. Members of the public can play a part by offering help to homeless individuals they encounter. They can call the ComCare hotline at 1800 222 0000, or approach the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre for assistance.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h3>Hidden in plain sight: Tackling homelessness in ‘crazy rich’ Singapore</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2019.12.31</p>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          While not easily visible, between 921 and 1,050 people in Singapore sleep on the streets every night. Why is the city-state leaving these vulnerable citizens behind?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In November 2019, a landmark study on Singapore’s homeless population was released. The nationwide street count, led by Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, unveiled for the first time the scale of homelessness within the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singapore may have been the rapacious backdrop for the Hollywood hit film Crazy Rich Asians, but there are up to 1,000 homeless citizens sleeping rough in the city-state every night.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Homelessness is not readily visible</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Singapore boasts one of the highest rates of homeownership in the world. In 2018, the figure stood at 91%. The phenomenon of homelessness in the island nation is not typically observable – unless one deliberately goes in search of those eking out a life on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was what a team of nearly 500 volunteer fieldworkers did over a period of three months to produce Homeless in Singapore: Results from A Nationwide Street Count. Starting work after 11.30 pm, the fieldworkers scoured over 12,000 blocks of housing flats as well as other public and commercial spaces to record the number of rough sleepers. They interviewed 88 of those they found sleeping on the streets.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe told ASEAN Today: “Research plays an important role by bringing social issues into the open and providing an evidence base for the planning of services and policies. As the economy and society change, we must continue to have research to update and deepen our understanding of homelessness.”
      </p>
      <img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2019-3-1.jpg %}" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%"/>
      <p>
        Singapore’s homeless population are easily overlooked. They rarely fit stereotypical profiles of the destitute and displaced. Many of the homeless in the city-state have “found ways to keep their appearance”, with nearly 30% of the rough sleepers were identified by fieldworkers as ‘presentable’ and most do not carry many possessions with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Many are employed and working but homeless</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of the homeless in Singapore, nearly 60%, hold down jobs. The nature of their employment often drove them to the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the homeless are working in low-wage and irregular jobs, with many working in the cleaning, security, and retail industries. The median wage of an employed homeless worker stands at S$1,400 (US$1,036) a month. The national median wage is $3,467 (US$2,564) in Singapore. Paying for rent or a mortgage with an income that is less than half that of the national median was impossible for many of the homeless interviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Segments of the population with lower skills and education levels are therefore more vulnerable to homelessness stemming from unstable and low-paying work. Some 76% of Singapore’s homeless population have a secondary school education or below. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, with the onset of an ageing population, insecure and low-paying work is particularly worrying as a pathway to homelessness. “In Singapore, homelessness is related to in-work poverty in old age. We found that homeless people here tend to be older because their homelessness is related to insecure work and low wages, which are most common among older workers,” Professor Ng told ASEAN Today. The average age of the homeless interviewed was 54, and more than half were judged by fieldworkers to be above the age of 50.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2019-3-2.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          Homelessness in the lion city is typically not a temporary condition. The study revealed that the majority of those who find themselves homeless in Singapore will likely remain so for years. Of those interviewed, half have been sleeping rough for between one and five years. Another third have been homeless for a period of six years or longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amongst those interviewed, 40% of the group had previously sought help but were still unable to escape their predicament. Social Service Offices, which disburse financial aid, and Members of Parliament (MPs) were the most likely parties for homeless to turn to for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Help has not been forthcoming. While up to 1,000 Singaporeans lay their heads on the streets every night, only around 290 people were recipients of assistance from the MSF.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Current schemes need to be beefed up to address homelessness</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The chronic nature of homelessness means that the mitigating solutions have to be multifaceted in targeting problem factors. “Homelessness needs to be addressed through multiple strategies. Services like outreach and befriending are important because they provide relief and support to homeless people. They can also help to connect homeless people to resources like financial assistance and overnight shelters. These services can be expanded,” Prof Ng elaborates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overnight shelters like Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)-funded Crisis Shelters and Transitional Shelters provide temporary accommodation and relief to the homeless. MSF also launched the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network in July 2019, bringing together 26 agencies including religious institutions in helping the homeless in Singapore.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2019-3-3.jpg %}" alt="" /><i>More than half of Singapore’s homeless population are above the age of 50.</i></span>
        <p>
          The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will be a key player in devising longer-term solutions to homelessness. Its public rental housing scheme is designed to help those most in need but strict eligibility criteria, like the joint tenancy requirement for singles to co-rent a one-room flat, have blunted the thrust.
        </p>
        <p>
          15% of the rough sleepers interviewed by fieldworkers had HDB rental flats in their names but the challenges that come with sharing an apartment with strangers and conflicts with co-tenants have deterred them from going home for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof Ng elaborates: “Inadequate conditions in public rental housing can both add to homelessness and prevent exit from it. The joint tenancy requirement for singles needs to be urgently removed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, more needs to be done to ensure that an inclusive social safety net is in place to prevent Singaporeans from descending into homelessness in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We need to restrict the pathways into homelessness and improve the exit routes into stable and secure housing,” Prof Ng informed ASEAN Today. But this will only come by looking at the problem as a multi-dimensional issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          “To prevent homelessness, we must make work conditions more secure and protect wages at the bottom and strengthen alternative provisions of income security in old age for those who are unable to work,” Ng concluded.

        <h3>1,000 homeless people found sleeping on Singapore streets: Nationwide study</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2019.11.15</p>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          SINGAPORE - The first nationwide study of homelessness in Singapore found that about 1,000 people were sleeping on the streets.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        They were sleeping rough in most parts of the island, but more were found in the older and larger housing estates such as in the city area, Bedok and Kallang. These areas also had more rental flats, as homelessness is linked to poverty. The study did not specify which areas in the city it was referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over eight in 10 of the homeless were men and of those interviewed, six in 10 were working, mostly in low-wage jobs like cleaning and as security guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half the number had been toughing it out on the streets for between one and five years, and nearly one-third did so for six years or longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        They slept in places like void decks, commercial buildings and playgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study was done by Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) at the National University of Singapore. He led a team of close to 500 volunteer fieldworkers who covered 12,000 blocks of flats and other public and commercial spaces over three months to count the numbers sleeping on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fieldworkers, who started work after 11.30 pm, recorded the number of people who were asleep or going to sleep in public spaces. These rough sleepers also had some form of bedding or many belongings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study also interviewed 88 of the homeless people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr Ng said: "Homelessness exists in Singapore. But despite growing policy and public attention in recent years, the size of the homeless population in Singapore is not known.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Knowing the number of homeless people and where they may be found allows services to be designed and organised in a systematic way."
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The key findings include:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Some six in 10 of the homeless were working but their median wage was $1,400 a month, compared to the national median wage of $3,467.</li>
          <li>About half said they were sleeping on the streets as they were unemployed, did not have regular jobs or earned very little. So they could not pay their rent or mortgage, or they had sold their house. Family conflicts and breakups were cited as another main reason for homelessness.</li>
          <li>Some 26 per cent either rented a flat from the Housing Board (HDB) at highly subsidised rates or bought an HDB flat. However, some chose not to go home because of conflicts with their co-tenant.</li>
          <li>Some 40 per cent of those interviewed had sought help in the past year. They did so from a number of places including the Social Service Offices which administer the Government's financial aid schemes or their Member of Parliament.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The study, which was released on Friday afternoon (Nov 8), is an independent one funded by a research grant from the LKYSPP. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) supported the study and also helped to mobilise social workers for the street count.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr Ng noted the complexity of their problems, saying that could be a reason why 40 per cent sought help but stilll found it hard to break out of their homeless predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Lee Kim Hua, a senior director at MSF, said the ministry defined a homeless person as someone "who feels he has no home to go back to, whether he owns a house or is renting a place".
      </p>
      <p>
        He said: "As long as he doesn't feel safe going back at night to sleep, we take it as homelessness."
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Lee said that ministry has stepped up its partnership with community groups to reach out to and aid the homeless over the past two years. This is needed, as among other reasons, some of the homeless may be afraid of and shun help from the authorities but not staff and volunteers from charities.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the key is for the community groups to engage them and build trust, and when they are ready, the ministry can extend the help needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ministry has brought together the different groups helping the homeless and in July, the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (Peers) Network was launched. It now has 26 members, such as the Catholic Welfare Services and the Homeless Hearts of Singapore.
      </p>
        Mr Lee said that the ministry is working with the Peers Network to build an interim shelter for those sleeping on the streets. There are currently three transitional shelters catering to the homeless.

        <h3>Is Homelessness a Problem in Singapore?</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2019.04.10</p>
      </header>
      <div>
        <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2019-2.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          The answer to that question is, in short, yes. According to a survey done by volunteers of a welfare organisation ‘Montfort Care’ and volunteer group ‘SW101’ in late 2017, there are 180 homeless people sleeping outdoors across 25 locations in Singapore.The same survey also debunked certain generalisations and stereotypes of homeless people in Singapore as being lazy or crazy given that two-thirds of the homeless people interviewed had a job, and more than one-quarter had a flat to their name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 2015 and 2017, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”) assisted an average of 385 homelessness cases each year. While this issue might appear invisible to the local eye, but in truth, this makes the issue an even more pertinent one to address.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article will provide some avenues of help you can direct homeless people to, depending on the nature of the help they require.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>
          Reasons Behind and Risks of Homelessness
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals may be in their plight due to multiple reasons – tenancy disagreements with their landlord, poorly managed finances, familial and spousal issues, unemployment, a victim of cheating or fraud, or simply because they do not understand their legal rights. One will also note that a majority of persons in such a situation tend to be of old age and/or are not as educated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst it is certainly not a crime to be homeless, many homeless persons may find themselves in a precarious situation, as many often have to resort to begging to earn an income. This might pose an issue as under the Destitute Person Act, habitual beggars that cause a “nuisance” in a public space may be penalised with a fine of $3,000 or imprisonment for up to 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may even exacerbate a homeless person’s situation, as most would not be able to pay up, should a fine be imposed. This might result in them having to serve a default sentence of imprisonment. Even a short stint in jail will adversely impact these persons, causing them to forgo income they would otherwise have earned or even to lose their job.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is, however, somewhat comforting to note that there have been no reported prosecutions under the said statute thus far.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a preventive measure, it may be useful for tenants or other persons at risk of homelessness to seek legal advice at an early stage. Many avenues to obtain legal advice exist, for instance, Pro-bono clinics which can help answer the legal questions of those at risk, and even homeless individuals. One such avenue is the Community Legal Clinic, which is administered by the Law Society Pro Bono Services at the Commnity Justice Centre in the State Courts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Homeless Shelters: Transitional Shelters</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have exhausted all other means of accommodation and are not eligible for Housing and Development Board (HDB) options can apply for temporary accommodation at the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s transitional shelters. One such transitional shelter is run by a social service organisation called AWWA that seeks to help displaced families obtain stable housing in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Eligibility for Transitional Shelters</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to MSF’s clarifications, Transitional Shelters are only available for the homeless if they have exhausted all other possibilities, such as seeking residence with a family member or a friend. Other disqualifying factors include if the individual has physical or mental health conditions that make it unsuitable for him or her to stay in a transitional shelter. In such situations, the social service worker or agency will refer the individual to the relevant care facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Homeless Shelters: Welfare Homes</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welfare homes are available to individuals who are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>unable to work;</li>
        <li>have no financial means;</li>
        <li>do not have accommodation;</li>
        <li>do not have family support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Such individuals will most likely be referred to welfare homes in Singapore. Currently, there are 10 welfare homes registered under the Destitute Persons Act to care for the aforementioned group of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Financial Aid</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals seeking financial help can look towards ComCare, an assistance scheme provided by the Government to support low-income individuals and families. ComCare programmes include Workfare, medical, education subsidies and housing assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Eligibility</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        To qualify for ComCare, individuals must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a household income of $1,900 and below or a per capita household income of $650 and below; and</li>
        <li>Be a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (with at least one immediate family member in the same household being a Singapore Citizen).</li>

        <b>How You Can Help </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing to remember is that every homeless individual has their own set of unique circumstances and may require help of a different nature than you envisioned. If you decide to approach a homeless individual (as we highly encourage that you do), try your best to understand their circumstances and their needs – factors such as their housing situation (whether they own or rent a flat but are sleeping on the streets for a different reason), employment situation, income, and family situation would be helpful when it comes to finding the appropriate avenue of help.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, homeless individuals may be in their situation due to a large number of reasons – a family dispute or conflict at home and other times, a homeless individual is in dire need of financial aid. In all of these situations, after you have understood their situation, here are some steps that you may take to extend your help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>refer them to or offer to bring them to the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre</li>
        <li>call the ComCare hotline (1800-222 0000) to ask for more information on how you may assist the homeless individual</li>
        <li>refer them to volunteer organisations such as the Homeless Hearts of Singapore (hyperlink: https://homeless.sg)</li>
        <li>refer them to a pro-bono clinic if they are undergoing any legal issues with tenancy disputes, or if they simply need help writing appeals to shelters that have rejected their application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if you encounter a homeless individual who is experiencing domestic violence at home, there are MSF crisis shelters available to them. Do offer to bring them to the nearest Family Service Centre or AWWA. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to note that many homeless persons are inherently hesitant to approach others for help or accept help. Whilst it is a noble task to reach out and help others, one must take sufficient care not to overstep personal boundaries. It might take some time and effort before the individual is willing to open himself up and accept your gesture, but this can only happen if mutual trust and respect is maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        People say, “Out of sight; out of mind”, but just because one does not see the invisible hardships which homeless people face does not mean that this problem does not exist. In the face of ever-increasing property prices, it is all the more important for our society to be equipped to prevent homelessness and to assist our homeless peers to find a place in our Home, truly.

        <h3>Commentary: Many may be forgotten if data drives public policy</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2018.07.22</p>
      </header>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A smart thing to do is to acknowledge that data by itself is not inherently smart and won’t automatically lead to the best solutions to social or economic problems, says one NTU observer.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        SINGAPORE: Singapore, like many other cities around the globe, has bet heavily on “big data” as a way to drive economic development and solve urban problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is widely seen as a kind of resource – the oil of the 21st century – that can be mined to “unlock value and innovation” as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has put it. Data is now touted as a powerful resource that will solve problems in healthcare, transport, crime, education, and bring new economic opportunities.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">

          <i>Registration counters at Punggol Polyclinic.</i>
        </span>
        <p>
          But such metaphors can be misleading. Data, unlike oil, is not something that is just sitting in the ground waiting to be collected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mostly generated by people – when we use our smartphones, ride the MRT, visit the doctor, surf the Internet or drive our cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of this data is captured by authorities including the Land Transport Authority, the Ministry of Health or other government bodies; others are sucked up by Singtel, Facebook, Google, or other private companies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But in almost all cases, data refers back to people, to us. And this means we need to be very careful how we use and interpret it. Data may not lie, but – like the people it comes from – it can be messy, incomplete and misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MISINTERPRETED, MISUSED DATA</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, for example, crime data is increasingly used to direct police to particular neighbourhoods. Famed American mathematician Cathy O’Neil has recently written about how sophisticated software such as Predpol and Hunchlab analyse crime statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Santa Cruz, California, for example, Predpol examined eleven years of data of past crimes to generate predictions about where future crimes may occur. These “hotspots” appear as red squares on a map on a computer screen. More police can now be sent to these areas.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">
          <img src="{% link assets/images/sg-2018-1-2.jpg %}" alt="" />
        </span>
        <p>
          So far, so good. But having a greater police presence in an area also means more crimes may be detected, especially petty crimes. These are then fed back into the software, making an area look even more dangerous and attracting an even greater police presence. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is that some neighborhoods end up with many more arrests and many more people being sent to jail. This is exactly what has happened in cities across the US including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That’s not fair, and it’s also not a smart use of data – it amplifies inequalities between groups. This could happen in Singapore too. One of the uses of big data here has been the use of locational information from our phones, collected by telcos in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns of foot traffic can be mined to find the most heavily walked areas within malls and shopping streets. This is used by retail brands to find the ideal location for their next outlet or by malls to set rental prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this kind of reasoning may contribute to a vicious cycle in which depressed areas remain depressed, while rich areas get richer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>DATA CAN EXACERBATE INEQUALITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Directing business to high-traffic neighbourhoods means that those areas will retain good jobs; this means less money and less spending in low-traffic neighbourhoods, potentially leading to even less economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of data may exacerbate the differences between the best-served and worst-served areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now this remains a hypothetical in Singapore, but elsewhere in the world the results of big data approaches are already becoming clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, US activist Virginia Eubanks has recently exposed how data-driven systems – such as the Homeless Management Information System in Los Angeles and the predictive risk modelling Allegheny Family Screening Tool in Pennsylvania – are trapping vulnerable individuals in cycles of poverty and homelessness.
      </p>

        </span>
        <p>
          If we begin to allocate public services – such as healthcare, education, public transportation – according to data, we need to make sure we’re interpreting it correctly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent news has highlighted the growing significance of big data in the healthcare sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          One report described how Fullerton Healthcare had examined data from medical transactions at public hospitals in Singapore, searching for spikes in reported cases of chronic conditions such as diabetes in particular areas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        When they found an uptick, the company tried to help areas in need by delivering health education and awareness campaigns about diet and healthy eating. In some areas, the number of medical claims dropped substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this data only captures those individuals who attended hospitals or clinics; it does not measure the actual occurrences of chronic disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are the most vulnerable may be left out of these statistics  - maybe because they find it difficult to travel to a doctor, or are worried about the costs of medical care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly the reduced number of claims is saving Fullerton money, but is it really serving the public interest?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MAKING DATA ACCESSIBLE</b>
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image right">

          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          One solution is to make data as open as possible – to let everyone see and use them. The Government’s data.gov.sg website aims to give Singaporeans access to large quantities of public data they can examine for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick glance at the portal reveals information about crime, housing, education, the economy, transport, health and many other areas. This is surely a good thing because we need as many people as possible to be aware of what data exists and participate in analysis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But opening up data does not solve every problem. We also need to know and take into account where and how data is collected and who it is collected from.
      </p>
      <p>
        If data is collected from web and smartphone users, for example, we can’t expect it to fairly represent the elderly population who are likely to use such technologies less. If data is collected from public transport, we can’t expect it to evenly reflect the whole socio-economic spectrum of Singapore, since wealthier individuals are more likely to drive, nor can we necessarily expect data to equally represent races, religions, or language groups.
      </p>
      <div>
        <span class="image left">

          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Of course, all this doesn’t mean we should abandon big data. But data requires great care in its interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is not inherently smart and won’t automatically lead to the best solutions to social or economic problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to temper the enthusiasm for data with continued awareness of its limitations. This means keeping an eye on who data represents, who it includes, and who it leaves out. That's the really smart thing to do.

        Singapore, similar to other cities, has relied heavily on big data as a way of driving economic development and solving urban problems such as homelessness, education, healthcare, transport, crime, and education. Data, mostly generated by people - smartphones, MRT, surfing on the internet, and visiting the doctor - and is utilized by the authorities including the Land Transport Authority and the Ministry of Health or other government bodies. Despite its abundance and accessibility, it can be messy, incomplete, or misleading. For instance, police forces in the United States have built software based on previous arrest and crime statistics to extrapolate and predict areas that are likely to have higher crime rates than others. Based on the software, more police officers are deployed to the area leading to higher arrest - whether that be of serious crimes or petty crimes - and feeding the statistics even though the increased crimes do not require as much police effort. Hence, areas with a high crime rate garner even higher crime rate not necessarily because there has been an increase in crimes but more are being detected and arrested. Data can also exacerbate inequality as corporations direct their high-paying business to already affluent areas; this use of data remains hypothetical in Singapore but elsewhere in the world the result of inequality exacerbation is evident. Further, the use of big data to solve an urban problem may be completely misleading. In the case of healthcare, big data of previous health care usage statistics may not produce ecologically valid prediction and reflection of Singapore’s healthcare system as it only accounts for previous healthcare uses - meaning it only includes those who could afford and have used the system, but not the others. Big data reveals past trends and incidents and provides a foundation or a source the government could utilize to solve modern problems, however how the data is collected needs to be taken into consideration. The majority of data is from smartphones meaning those who cannot afford to have a phone, who do not have a phone by choice, or the elderly who may not use a phone are excluded from the bid data. Hence, keeping an eye on whom data represents, whom it includes, and whom it leaves out is vital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big data provides a useful tool for Singapore to solve its urban issues such as the homeless. It helps compile causes of homelessness, categorize it based on characteristics of the homeless such as age, ethnicity, past history, mental illness, and physical illness, aggregate the general movement of the homeless population within Singapore, and more. It provides more in-depth and detailed information on past and current homelessness; it is a vital tool and a prerequisite for increasingly data-dependent Singapore. However, the reliability and validity of the big data of homelessness in Singapore need to be assessed with critical eyes. Government involvement in producing favorable data and reducing homelessness could be possible. Measuring homelessness is also difficult as approaching the homeless and gaining in-depth information on the reasons for their homelessness is difficult. Further, tracking each homeless requires abundant and effective outreach efforts.The trends and evaluations based on the data could provide a useful tool to have a better understanding of homelessness in Singapore but where and how the data is collected as well as its potential weaknesses needs to be taken into account.

        SINGAPORE- Although they were aged only eight and nine, Rita and Alfred (not their real names) received no care or supervision and were expected to do all their family's household chores, as well as look after their four younger siblings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They loitered in the neighbourhood to beg for food and money and were caned, slapped and hit with a belt by their father - who even threw dumbbells and padlocks at them.

          The Ministry of Social and Family Development was alerted to their case last year and the family was referred to Safe Space, a child protection specialist centre. Today they are one of the families benefiting from its support and services. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On Tuesday (March 20), Safe Space was officially opened. It is the third child protection specialist centre set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development(MSF) and is run by Pave, a family specialist centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other two centres are Big Love run by Montfort Care and Heart @ Fei Yue run by Fei Yue Community Services.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Alfred and Rita's case is not an isolated one. Last year social workers helped 997 clients with family violence issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space helps children under 16 who are victims or witnesses of domestic violence. It handles "moderate risk" child abuses cases referred by the Child Protective Services of the MSF and the public. The centre began its operations on January 3 last year and moved into Yishun Central early this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year, Safe Space has dealt with 128 cases and about 239 enquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children are referred there by the MSF's Child Protective Services, the Family Justice Courts, as well as by relatives and members of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gracing the opening ceremony was President Halimah Yacob who said that young children who are witnesses or victims of violence find it difficult to articulate what happened to them or identify who was responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The families of these children also face multiple stressors such as unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues and matrimonial difficulties. More often than not, they lack the support of an extended family and other social networks that most of us are blessed with," she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Family violence is an issue that cuts across racial, religious and socio-economic lines. When all of us put children's safety and welfare first, and when we all work together, great change can happen for the most vulnerable children."
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space staff work closely with government organisations such as the Child Protective Service, the health system, schools, the police, legal aid, the social service system and community organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pave is Singapore's pioneer family violence specialist centre. It began as a programme initiated in 1999 by three social workers who felt that family violence needed closer attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        President of Pave, Mr Michael Gray, said: "If children have a Safe Space to have their voices heard and their feelings acknowledged, we offer them a different life journey - one that hopefully will allow them to enjoy their childhood and move on."

        Safe Space is a child protection specialist center. When potential domestic abuse and violence is reported to the Ministry of Social and Family Development, families are referred to Safe Space. Safe Space was opened on March 20th, 2018, and is the third child protections specialist center set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development and is run by Pave, a family specialist center. In 2017, social workers helped 997 clients with family violence issues. Safe Space helps chilcdren under 16 who have survived or witnesses of domestic violence and handles “moderate risk” child abuse cases referred by the Child Protectve Services. In 2018, Safe Space has dealt with 128 cases and 239 enquiries. According to Safe Space President Halimah Yacob, the children who survived or witnessed abuse face “difficulties in articulating what happened or identifying what happened … and face multiple stressors such as unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues and matrimonial difficulties.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe Space, and Singapore’s Child Protective Services, provides institutional connection and help to find and assess potential child abuse cases and provide shelters for the children. It provides shelter and prevents further damage and trauma the children have to endure through. When children are abused, the knee-jerk reaction of them is to blame themselves and block the memories out as a survival coping mechanism to paint the abuser in a good light - brainwashing themselves to cope with the abuse. They face difficulties in articulating what they are feeling, what happened to them are under various stressors no children should be subjected to. Further, according to Pluck et al. (2013), childhood abuse has multiple negative impacts on lifetime development such as personality disorder and substance abuse. Homelessness and child abuse have a high linear positive correlation, as well, with child abuse high in homelessness and child abuse victims in homelessness. To break the cycle of abuse and homelessness, institutions such as Safe Space and Child Protective Services need to increase its effort from reactive to proactive to send outreach workers to assess for any undetected child abuse.

          One of them was carpenter and odd-jobs worker Chua Yong Sia, 61, who has been sleeping on the streets in Chinatown for the last three to four years. He said there are about 10 to 20 people sleeping in the area every day.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Why is it that one of the richest countries in the world (according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)) with the highest Budget surplus per capita in the billions almost every year – have so many homeless who are elderly?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, arguably – it may be our “not so compassionate” public housing rental policies which may be contributing to this homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may like to try this out and experience it for yourself – when you see a homeless person – call the ComCare hotline 18002220000 (you can see posters all over Singapore encouraging you to call when you come across a needy person).
      </p>
      <p>
        What typically happens next is that the homeless person may be placed in a homeless shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, generally – the stay in a homeless shelter cannot be indefinite, and is subject to regular review – every three or six months typically.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, some of the homeless end up homeless again, and their arguably, only long term housing solution is to rent a HDB 1-room rental flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the requirements (which I understand has not changed for decades despite inflation) are that two single men of age at least 35 years old must somehow find each other, and their combined monthly income cannot exceed $1,500.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are lucky enough to find another homeless roommate whom you think you can live with – it may be quite difficult to meet the combined monthly income criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you agree that such “not so compassionate” policies may need to be reviewed?

        Restaurant owners give blankets to those sleeping on Chinatown streets as the cool winter approaches in Singapore. It is estimated that the owner has given out about 100 blankets so far, each costing around $10 per piece. Mr. Ng, embarked on a solo journey and managed to give out 9 blankets to the homeless in an hour. Most were elderly men. The reason for disproportionately high elderly population in the homeless demographic is likely to be “not so compassionate” public housing rental policies. When a homeless person calls for ComCare hotline, they are placed in a shelter for three or six months. Some end up homeless again which calls for a long term housing solution - renting out 1-room HDB flat. However, the requirement for HDB flat, two men or a couple of people, aged at least 35 years old, restricts any other homeless unable to find a roommate or live with a roommate systematically discriminated against from the HDF public housing scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “not so compassionate policies” are also discriminatory as it prioritizes families with children or elderly. Meaning, single men faced relatively more difficulty in receiving any help from the government although single men were the largest demographic in Singapore’s homeless population. Many homeless also recalled being “humiliated” when they called for help from social workers. This mainly stems from the importance of meritocracy and hard work in Singaporean culture. Meaning, if someone was homeless, it is because of their merit, or lack thereof. The cultural approach contributed to a lack of compassion. Once homeless were allocated into the shelter, only a small proportion of them were given transitional housing and they had to wait a long time. The system was rigid and produced a long waiting time. For Singapore to combat homelessness, not only does the waiting time need to be shortened but long affordable housing and solutions to tackle the root causes of homelessness such as training, job search, education, and mental illness support needed.

          Homelessness is a "complex issue" with many underlying causes, ranging from financial to marital and family difficulties.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said this in response to questions sent by The Straits Times about the findings of a survey done by SW101 and Montfort Care.
      </p>
      <p>
        It added that in dealing with homelessness, the Government works with various parties to address underlying issues, such as providing employment assistance, counselling to address marital and family issues, or link-ups to other services such as childcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        "MSF looks into all cases brought to our attention, to ascertain the individuals' situations. Our priority is to ensure their immediate needs are met and they receive support to address their long-term housing and living needs," it said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vulnerable individuals, such as women and children, are given immediate assistance and admitted to crisis shelters, it added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families who have exhausted all housing options may be admitted into transitional shelters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older persons who have physical or mental health conditions, no means of supporting themselves, or no family able or willing to support them are admitted to welfare homes, it said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, even as we seek to provide support to the needy in our community, there are some who prefer to be self-reliant or decline assistance for other reasons."
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, the MSF dealt with 269 cases of homelessness, which it defined to be people with no means of accommodation. Its figures exclude those who have a home but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes or other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the 269 cases, 93 were of families who went into transitional shelters, and 176 were of individuals who went into transitional shelters or welfare homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, MSF dealt with 296 cases.

        According to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), homelessness is a “complex issue” with many underlying causes, ranging from financial to marital and family difficulties. The government works with various parties to address issues such as providing employment assistance, counseling, and a network of service institutions such as childcare. MSK looks into all cases to ascertain the individual’s situations and customize help plans to ensure immediate needs are met then support systems are given to address their long-term and living needs. Further, vulnerable individuals such as women and children are given immediate assistance and admitted to crisis shelters. Families who have exhausted all remaining housing options are admitted to transitional housing. MSF defined homelessness as people with no means of accommodations which excludes those who have a home but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes and other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homelessness is a diverse and complex issue with dynamic, complex, and diverse underlying causes. A reason for the homelessness of an individual may be a combination of personal, mental, physical, reasons on a microscale, macro reasons such as increasing rents and living costs, increasing low-wage working and competition, and relationship-based reasons such as family disputes. Hence, trying to solve homelessness through a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach will not be effective. Although MSF, claims to, assess each case of homelessness to gain in-depth verstehen and insights as to what the unique combinations of reasons for homelessness are and offer appropriate help, the method excludes people who may have a home - as the definition of homelessness is those without means of accommodation. To ensure an ecologically valid population is covered and given helps, the definition of homelessness needs to encompass inclusive meanings of homelessness.

        <h3>180 found sleeping on streets</h3>
        <p style="padding: -0.5em 0 0 0;">2017.10.07</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Volunteers find many of them have jobs and do not fit stereotypes of homeless people</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Over a five-hour stretch, 100 volunteers found 180 people sleeping outdoors across 25 locations in Singapore. Most were men aged above 50, and a good proportion had jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This point-in-time survey is believed to be the first of its kind here. It was done in March by volunteer welfare organisation Montfort Care and volunteer group SW101, which focuses on issues facing low-income individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the 180 people, 84 answered some or all of the survey questions, which ranged from personal particulars, like age and educational background, to home ownership. The rest declined or were already asleep. Those sleeping outdoors were found mainly in parks such as East Coast Park and at HDB blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exercise, conducted from 9pm to 2am, also revealed that 21 had been sleeping outdoors for more than a year, and 18 for more than five years.
      </p>

            Of the 180 people found sleeping outdoors by volunteers over a five-hour period in March, 21 had been sleeping outdoors for more than a year and 18 for more than five years.
          </i>
        </span>
        <p>
          Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe, who is part of the research effort, said he was alarmed by how long people were sleeping in public. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "You would think that if people were sleeping outside, if these were the numbers and if it has been happening for so long, we would have noticed. I think it reminds us how invisible they often are," said Prof Ng, who is from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That 60 per cent of them were working - 58 per cent full-time, 38 per cent in casual employment - was another finding that surprised the team. Most of those with jobs were cleaners or security guards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A quarter of those surveyed have a registered address, often a rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The homeless people found did not fit stereotypes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Said Prof Ng: "They are able-bodied, and they are actually holding down jobs - just not very rewarding jobs. The low wages are a reminder of the work issues that a particular segment of the population faces."
      </p>
      <p>
        The point-in-time count methodology is common in the United States and Britain, where it is used to monitor homeless populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        When The Straits Times visited Chinatown late on Monday night, there were people sleeping across plastic chairs, on cardboard laid out on benches, and with their heads down on the tables of 24-hour coffee shops. One, slumped on the table in a coffee shop, said he has a job clearing tables at People's Park Complex.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>KEY FINDINGS</b>
        <p>
          Members of SW101, a volunteer group of social workers and academics, and staff from charity Montfort Care found 180 people sleeping on the streets here. They were conducting a street survey to find out how many people were sleeping in public and therefore might be homeless. These are the key findings of their survey:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>61 per cent were aged 50 and older; 24 per cent were in their 20s to 40s.</li>
          <li>88 per cent were men.</li>
          <li>Of the 84 who answered a question on their marital status, 40 per cent said they were single.</li>
          <li>23 out of 84 had an HDB flat in their name - 15 were rental flats and five were purchased.</li>
          <li>48 out of 80 who answered about their employment were employed.</li>
          <li>
            Of the 74 who answered a question on their education level, 53 per cent said they had primary school education or less, 40 per cent had secondary school education, 8 per cent had post-secondary certificates or diplomas.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) clarified that some may have homes but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes, or because they are shift workers who want to be near their workplaces. MSF said it assists in about 300 homeless cases each year - which it defined as people who have no means of accommodation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But while the Government can house them in shelters, some prefer the freedom of living on the streets, said Mr Abraham Yeo, 35, founder of volunteer group Homeless Hearts, which befriends the homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prof Ng's team also found that, in the past year, none of those sleeping on the streets had asked for help from shelters, and less than 20 per cent had sought help from friends and family, MPs and the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development, said measures are in place to help the homeless find shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hoped people can encourage those sleeping in public to seek help. "We should be concerned for the homeless for their security and well-being, regardless of the reasons for them not going home," he said. "Only with proper shelter can they set about rebuilding their lives."
      </p>
      <p>
        Prof Ng suggested one way forward is for outreach efforts and shelter services to be expanded. But it is important for the public to first understand the challenges faced by the homeless: "When the public is not aware of the problem, our society cannot begin to address it properly."

        Over a five-hour search by 100 volunteers found 180 people sleeping outdoors across 25 locations in Singapore. Most were men aged above 50 and had jobs. The search is first of its kind and was conducted by a volunteer welfare organization called Montfort Care and SW101 which focuses on issues low-income individuals face. Out of 150, 60 percent of them worked. Amongst the 60 percent, 58 percent had a full-time job and 38 percent were in casual employment. A quarter of the survey respondents had a registered address - often a rental flat under Joint Singles Scheme. Assistant Professor Ng Ko Hoe, a part of the research effort, commented on the demographic being “able-bodied … actually holding down jobs - just not rewarding jobs.” Professor Ng commented the low wages are a “reminder of the work issues that the particular segment of the population faces.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The point-in-time count methodology was first used in Singapore to track the homeless. The methodology provides quantitative insights of general trends in the homeless population and the main areas the homeless population inhabit in Singapore - hence, incorporating it more to annually track the homeless population would better prepare the government and non-profit organizations from setting the size-specific and location-specific policies. The fact that it was used for the first time reflects how not prepared and equipped Singapore is to track homeless statistics. The Singapore government must incorporate the measure to quantitatively track down the demographic. Further, the survey population contradicts the general consensus of stereotypes of homeless people - lazy and jobless. To solve homelessness, providing opportunities and interventions to increase their wages such as through job training and job searching could increase their wages and better prepare them to rent out a flat.
